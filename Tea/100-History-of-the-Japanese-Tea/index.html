On their way back they brought tea with them as they grow used to drink it while in China an during meditation sessions. The two monks we have knowledge of are, Saicho that introduced around Kyoto. And Kukai, that did into Wakayama.</p><p>This first introduction was tea most probably in powder form that they brought. It was introduced into the temples but nothing more happened for a few hundred years.</p><a href=#12th-century><h3 id=12th-century><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>12th Century</h3></a><p>1190&rsquo;s with monk Eisai was the real &ldquo;start&rdquo; of Tea in Japan. Some might say that the tree was already there and was not first introduced from the outside. But there is no way to know. Others argue that the tea was there already but people did not know about it&rsquo;s properties until later on.</p><a href=#miyoe-monk><h2 id=miyoe-monk><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Miyoe monk</h2></a><p><a class="internal-link broken">Eisai</a> brought not only tea but also seeds, those where planted in an Island in the region of 長崎 Nagasaki, 佐賀 Saga located in 九州 Kyushu island and in 京都 Kyoto as well.</p><p>Eisai not only did that but also wrote the <a class="internal-link broken">Kissa Yojoki</a> a book about the benefits of drinks for health, and Eisai recommend tea, as well as Mulberry infusion.</p><p>1269 Chabustusan, a book about tea-ware published in China but with illustrations depicting the mills for grounding tea, one similar to the traditional one for Matcha as wells a more common one for medicinal herbs or spices. There is as well others like a whisk. 800 years ago tea in powder form <a href=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6>Matcha 抹茶</a> was already there, produced and consumed but, the shading techniques where not yet invented.</p><p>So we can see that the tea was ground, added with water int a bowl and whisked just like matcha today but without the shading. 茶色 gives a hint on the original type of tea at that time as it means brown colour. So probably the colour of the powder tea consumed at that time was brown and very different from the <a href=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6>Matcha 抹茶</a> we are used now.</p><a href=#13th-century><h3 id=13th-century><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>13th Century</h3></a><p>Tea as medicine is the main topic and use.</p><a href=#14th---15th-century><h3 id=14th---15th-century><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>14th - 15th Century</h3></a><p>茶香服 Chakabuki, a game consisting on tasting blindly several bowls, 9 or 11 of teas and guess which one is the &ldquo;real tea&rdquo;, the one grown in Kyoto.

The gambling was eventually prohibited although never very much enforced.</p><a href=#15th--16th-century><h3 id=15th--16th-century><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>15th -16th Century</h3></a><p>1580&rsquo;s some parts of the society, specially in the temples saw the getting out of the temples into the palaces and lavish tea parties. This part of society tried to bring it back to the ceremonial root s of the origins. The most well know actor in this movement was Sen no Rikyu. He was not the first one to start the movement but he codified and written the practice that eventually derived into the main 3 schools of tea ceremony and the others as well.</p><p>1650&rsquo;s is the start of the loose-leaf tea in japan, thanks to Ingen monk. Ingen was a monk from china coming to Japan to build a temple in Kyoto, in Uji, the Manpukuji. In China originally they drink powder tea, until that time Japan used to consume it in the same powder form. Ingen became the first one to bring the new way that was already in China into Japan. Farmers then started to develop news techniques more suited for this new method of brewing. This tea was probably something similar to <a href=/quartz/Tea/Kamairicha-%E9%87%9C%E7%82%92%E3%82%8A%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Kamairicha-%E9%87%9C%E7%82%92%E3%82%8A%E8%8C%B6>Kamairicha 釜炒り茶</a> as the <a href=/quartz/Tea/Pan-fired-teas rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Pan-fired-teas>Pan-fired teas</a> was the method used in China and Japan still hadn&rsquo;t developed the <a href=/quartz/Tea/Steamed-processed-teas-%E8%92%B8%E3%81%97%E8%A3%BD rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Steamed-processed-teas-%E8%92%B8%E3%81%97%E8%A3%BD>Steamed processed teas 蒸し製</a> production methods.</p><p>Somewhere around the 15 and 16th Century shading is used to protect the crops from the cold weather and frost. By the 18th Century it was widely used in <a href=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6>Matcha 抹茶</a> and later in <a href=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6>Gyokuro 玉露茶</a> production as well. A change in flavour on the places were this shading was used was the primer for shading the tea, making the final product more sweet and pleasant.</p><p>Around 1735 <a href=/quartz/Tea/Baisao-%E5%A3%B2%E8%8C%B6%E7%BF%81 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Baisao-%E5%A3%B2%E8%8C%B6%E7%BF%81>Baisao 売茶翁</a> is serving tea in leaf form, as he learned in the monastery he was a monk in, as a tea peddler around the city of Kyoto. By 1738 his brewing style was more common and popular and the years leading to that fruited in to the experimentation by the tea farmers to create the loose leaf tea version of Japan.</p><p>In 1738 Nagatani Souen in Uji, invented a new production method that is the base for modern tea production in Japan, at that time <a href=/quartz/Tea/Sencha-%E7%85%8E%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Sencha-%E7%85%8E%E8%8C%B6>Sencha 煎茶</a>. And eventually all the other teas as well. The method included the use of <a href=/quartz/Tea/Steamed-processed-teas-%E8%92%B8%E3%81%97%E8%A3%BD rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Steamed-processed-teas-%E8%92%B8%E3%81%97%E8%A3%BD>Steamed processed teas 蒸し製</a> done by hand in a paper covered table.</p><p>In 1835 came the invention of <a href=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6>Gyokuro 玉露茶</a>, mainly by change. At that time <a href=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Matcha-%E6%8A%B9%E8%8C%B6>Matcha 抹茶</a> powder was still the main tea, and <a href=/quartz/Tea/Japanese-tea-shading-techniques rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Japanese-tea-shading-techniques>Japanese tea shading techniques</a> were used. The producers where prompted to try create a loose-leaf tea out of the shaded leafs as well and thus creating the <a href=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Gyokuro-%E7%8E%89%E9%9C%B2%E8%8C%B6>Gyokuro 玉露茶</a>. That was then moved to the capital Tokyo and it became a hit.</p><p>1884 Japan was &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to open borders and tea was already expanded and consumed around the world in many countries. Japan decided to export it&rsquo;s tea production as well. For this they created the <a class="internal-link broken">Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association 公益社団法人日本茶業中央会</a> was created, to boost exports and still exists today.</p><p>1885 Kenzo Takabayashi, a medical doctor, observing that the tea production was still 100% done by hand, created the Sencha processing machine. The principles on how it works still apply in most part in modern machines. This machine helped produce more quantity. Also provide a way to compete better in the export trends after the borders i Japan opened after 1884.</p><p>1904 <a href=/quartz/Tea/Yabukita-%E3%82%84%E3%81%B6%E3%81%8D%E3%81%9F rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Tea/Yabukita-%E3%82%84%E3%81%B6%E3%81%8D%E3%81%9F>Yabukita やぶきた</a> Cultivar is registered.
