It is generally an unshaded tea, but it can be shaded as well, known as [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]. The term 露地煎茶 (roadside Sencha) and 純煎茶(じゅん煎茶) (pure Sencha) is also used for unshaded sencha, helping with the division between shaded and unshaded sencha. For both, harvesting is usually machine harvested. Harvest season is usually spring and Summer.\n\nIt was in its origins processed via [[notes/Pan-fired teas]] techniques. This can still be seen in the name 煎ったお茶. The name sencha itself can be translated as roasted tea as well. In the actuality, sencha is processed via the [[notes/Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] techniques almost exclusively. If there is a variation, it is usually categorised under a different name.\n\nThe shading is applied to reduce the light exposition of the leafs, which in turn reduces the Catechin content and improving the sweetness in the cup. The direct shading of the tea bushes is said to give a 被せ香 a sweet humid resemblance to the earth/soil.\n\nA brewed sencha cup should be, 金色透明 (きんしょくとうめい), golden colour and clear. But as a Japanese green tea bright green colours are also sought after, that is another one of the reasons sometimes it gets shaded.

Which is a steamed and dried tea for matcha production. The process of rolling the leaf was invented by Nagatani Soen. Rolling the leafs creates a better release of flavours when infused. Several schools on hand-rolling techniques were born by the Tea masters (茶師), in 1905 a \"national\" style merging  several schools was established. \n\nMechanisation happened in two phases, first for the Steaming and initial rolling, being finished by hand. Later on other machines where developed for the more fine, dedicated rolling. Hand-rolling is maintained by some artisans, producing very small batches, usually for competition grade teas. Hand-rolling tea techniques are considered \"intangible national treasures\" by the Japanese government.\n\n## The Steam processing style\nUnlike other countries like China or Korea, Japan uses steam to stop the oxidation process post-harvest. Similar methods of [[Pan-fired teas]] can be found in Japanese teas as well. If the leafs are let to wither for too long it will show up in the tea, which traditionally happened due to the time it took to process the leafs by hand or simply by transportation from the field to the production facility. When the leaf becomes partially oxidised it is on it's way to be processed as a [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] or if fully oxidised to a [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]]. This two might be similar or not to other countries Oolongs or Black teas, but usually the taste profile is completely different.\n\nThis processing style is used in the main three types of Japanese green tea, and as a part of the process for others types as well. Thee \"big three\" are, [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]].\n\n### Steaming\nThe use heat to stop the oxidase enzyme is commonly know as kill-green (殺青). In the case of Japanese green teas steam is the main chosen type of heat.\n\nThe application of steam (烝熱) needs to be applied as soon as the leaf is harvested. The time needed is of at least 10 to 20 seconds. Both time and temperature are regulated by equipment  to be able to do a more controlled application of the heat. In the hand processing way, this was achieved by stacking bamboo trays on top of each other over a source of steam.\n\nDepending on the duration of the steaming process the final product can be classified as:\n- [[Asamushi 淺蒸し]], lightly steamed.\n- [[Futsuumushi 普通蒸し]], normal/regular steamed. \n- [[Fukamushi 深蒸し]], deeply steamed.\n\nGenerally speaking The shorter times preserve the flavour of the original product and the shape of the leaf as well. It usually translates into a more vigorous tea arome in the final tea.\nLonger times create a more mellow and richer body texture.\n\nFrom here on we can follow the [[#Hand production 手揉み茶]] or the [[#Mechanized production]]\n\n## Hand production 手揉み茶\n\n### Airing 茶振るい・葉振るい\nAfter the steaming the humidity of the leafs as well as the one added by the steam needs to be removed. This is true for residual heat that might still be present. For this the leafs can be moved around by tossing them into the air until they are dry. In the hand process a heated table is used to aid with the drying. \n\n### Kneading and rolling 回転揉み\nSmall amounts of leafs placed in the heated table are \"kneaded\" in a rotating motion while adding some pressure as well. Pressing the leafs will start to extracte the moisture in the leafs out. When there is moisture on the surface the process pivots to airing again until dry. This process is repeated until the inside moisture is gone and the leaf is dry.\n\nThe pressure also crushes the internal structure which translates into an easier release of its components when brewed.\n\n### Straightening 玉とき・玉解き\nProcess only found in the hand production of tea. After the kneading most of the leafs are curled up, the process is rudimentary yet is a very distinctive trait of a manual processed tes. Each leaves is picked, uncurled and straightened, one by one.\n\n### Final rolling 揉みきり\nThe leafs are rolled to shape them into needle shape, characteristic of the Japanese green teas. There are two main styles こくりstyle でんぐりstyle.\n\nThe heated table is turned down in this stage but due to the rolling of the leafs some drying still occurs, but the main process is still the shaping of the leafs. At this stage the tea is finished shape wise, although extra refining can be taken to further enhance the tea, mainly shape it into tighter thinner needles.\n\n### Itazuri 板ずり\nA wooden board is used to guide the needles into a certain direction, this board has horizontal groves helping achieve a thinner shape.\n\n### Final drying 乾燥\nAfter the final rolling the leaf is dryed further to around 5% humidity to improve the self life of the finished tea. This is done in drawers with a metal mesh to allow heat to circulate in a heated cabinet or oven.\n\nAt this stage 火入れ or \"branding\" is applied to the tea. This branding can be very noticeable or not depending on the producer or regionality traditions. It allows to the manufacturer to imprint the final product. A stronger branding will showcase more nutty flavours and a lighter one will preserve the original traits of the tea leaf.\n\n## Mechanized production\n\n### Airing 葉打ち・茶振るい \nSame way as for [[#Hand production 手揉み茶]] after the steaming the humidity of the leafs needs to be removed, and for any residual heat that might still be present. For this the leafs can be moved around by air in large series of vertical columns until they are dry. \n\n### Initial beating 粗揉 (そじゅう) Rough rolling\nThe leafs are inserted into a heated drum that moves around the leafs and dries them using hot air. At the same time the drum has spatulas in its axis that press the leafs against the wall of the drum. This process allows to move the sap and juices to the exterior were it can be removed thus initiating the drying of the leaf.\n\n### Kneading 揉捻 (じゅうねん)Twisting\nA ball of leaves is rolled in a circular motion against a horizontal embossed board with some downward pressure on the leafs. This stage corresponds to the [[#Kneading and rolling 回転揉み]] in the manual processing. The main purpose is to break the cellular structure for a better release of the compounds in the brew. Also some humidity will get extracted as well.\n\n### Agitation 中揉 (中揉) middle rolling \nSimilar to [[#Initial beating 粗揉 そじゅうそじゅう Rough rolling]], the leafs are inserted in a rolling drum equipped with kneading arms. This will press the leaves against the bamboo striped walls, rolling and untwisting the leafs, preparing them for the final rolling stage. At the same time hot air is injected to continue drying and reducing the humidity in the leaf. \n\n### Shaping 精揉 (せいじゅう) fine rolling\nThis process is the equivalent to [[#Final rolling 揉みきり]] in the hand processing method. It gives the leafs the final needle shape by brushing them back and forth against a bamboo rolling boars, similar in idea to the [[#Itazuri 板ずり]] board. During this stage hot air is still being used to keep drying the leaf.\n\n### Final drying 乾燥 (かんそう)\nEqual to the final drying in the hand process style, after the final rolling the leaf is dried further to around 5% humidity to improve the self life of the finished tea. This is done in drawers with a metal mesh to allow heat to circulate in a heated cabinet or oven.\n\nAt this stage 火入れ or \"branding\" is applied to the tea. This branding can be very noticeable or not depending on the producer or regionality traditions. It allows to the manufacturer to imprint the final product. A stronger branding will showcase more nutty flavours and a lighter one will preserve the original traits of the tea leaf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[The Story of Japanese Tea]]\n[[Japanese Tea - A comprehensive guide]]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qxIJgY-DY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0geWfdYLgE\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202208111803\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T21:39:33.720555379Z","tags":null},"/notes/Temperature":{"title":"Temperature and Infusion time relation","content":"\n\nasdkajsgdlhjkasgdjuk\n\nStatus: 🌱\n# Temperature and Infusion time relation\nDifferent temperatures solubilise different compounds, like caffeine for example. The time will in part allow more of them to be diffused into the brew. Sometimes it can also happen that a compound is present in the brew but not solubilised, this is especially true in lower temperature infusions.\n\nThe three most well know components for green tea are amino-acids, caffeine and catechin. While amino-acids are easily solubilised even at lower temperatures, caffeine and catechin are no so soluble. Their solubilisation and total transfer %  increases greatly as the temperature is higher. This makes it easier for transferring them into the brew together with all the other compounds that make a tastier cup into the brew. It is not always the desired result or the best to present a balance and the most umami into the cup without bitterness in high grade teas like [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]].\n\nAmino acids will imbue the brew with umami and sweet notes while compounds like caffeine and catechin provide the cup with bitterness or astringency. Lower temperature usually presents umami, sweetness, bitterness and astringency in balance. Present but not overwhelming, this can be a desirable cup but most of the time lacking in intensity if the period of infusion is to short. \n\nA higher temperature results in a stronger cup if the brew time is too long, excessive water temperature or both. It usually also presents a more prominent astringency and bitterness. \n\nIt is important then to adapt the brew time and water temperature to that that most suit the quality and process of the tea, as well as, the type of brew we want to result of it. [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], high gra [[notes/Kabusecha]] will probably benefit of a lower temperature  with a longer initial brew. In the case of high grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] is not uncommon to use as low a 40-50ºC with 1-2 minutes infusion with a very short ratio of tea:water to extract as much umami and sweetness out of it as possible. \n\nBrews o[[hojicha]] Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶](notes/Hojicha) can traditionally be brewed with boiling water directly in a water kettle for several minutes, resulting in a very intense brew.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202209181802\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T21:39:33.720555379Z","tags":null}}
