The time will in part allow more of them to be diffused into the brew. Sometimes it can also happen that a compound is present in the brew but not solubilised, this is especially true in lower temperature infusions.\n\nThe three most well know components for green tea are amino-acids, caffeine and catechin. While amino-acids are easily solubilised even at lower temperatures, caffeine and catechin are no so soluble. Their solubilisation and total transfer %  increases greatly as the temperature is higher. This makes it easier for transferring them into the brew together with all the other compounds that make a tastier cup into the brew. It is not always the desired result or the best to present a balance and the most umami into the cup without bitterness in high grade teas like [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]].\n\nAmino acids will imbue the brew with umami and sweet notes while compounds like caffeine and catechin provide the cup with bitterness or astringency. Lower temperature usually presents umami, sweetness, bitterness and astringency in balance. Present but not overwhelming, this can be a desirable cup but most of the time lacking in intensity if the period of infusion is to short. \n\nA higher temperature results in a stronger cup if the brew time is too long, excessive water temperature or both. It usually also presents a more prominent astringency and bitterness. \n\nIt is important then to adapt the brew time and water temperature to that that most suit the quality and process of the tea, as well as, the type of brew we want to result of it. [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], high grade [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] will probably benefit of a lower temperature  with a longer initial brew. In the case of high grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] is not uncommon to use as low a 40-50ºC with 1-2 minutes infusion with a very short ratio of tea:water to extract as much umami and sweetness out of it as possible. \n\nBrews of [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] can traditionally be brewed with boiling water directly in a water kettle for several minutes, resulting in a very intense brew.\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[日本茶のすべてが分かる本]]\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202209181802\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/000-Japanese-Tea-MOC":{"title":"Japanese Tea MOC","content":"## MOCs \n[[100 Foundation Course MOC]]\n[[100 History of the Japanese Tea]]\n[[100 Important figures MOC]]\n[[200 Cultivar 品種 MOC]]\n[[200 Tea Components MOC]]\n[[200 Intermediate Course MOC]]\n[[300 日本茶のすべてが分かる本 MOC]]\n\n## History events and developments\n[[100 History of the Japanese Tea]]\n\n## Tea Variations in Japan\n### Non fermented teas 不発酵茶・Green teas 緑茶\n#### [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]]\n- [[Sencha 煎茶]]\n- [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]]\n- [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]\n- [[Bancha 番茶]]\n- [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] Steamed variant\n- [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] once ground [[Matcha 抹茶]]\n##### Reprocessed teas 再加工茶\n- [[Genmaicha 玄米茶]]\n- [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]]\n##### By-product teas 副産物\n- [[Kukicha 茎茶]]\n- [[Konacha 粉茶]]\n\n#### [[Pan-fired teas 釜炒り茶]]\n- [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] Pan-fired variant, usually named [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]]\n\n### Partially fermented teas 不発酵茶・Oolong teas ウーロン茶\n- ほうしゅちゃ　包種茶\n- [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]]\n\n### Fully fermented teas 発酵茶・Black teas 紅茶]]\n- [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]]\n\n\n### \"other\" teas\n\n- [[Kyobancha 京番茶]]\n- [[Sanpincha さんぴん茶・ジャスミン茶]]\n- [[Hakuyoucha 白葉茶]]\n\n## Manufacturing\n- [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]]\n- [[Pan-fired teas 釜炒り茶]]\n\n\n## Cultivation techniques \n- [[Japanese tea shading techniques]]\n\n## The 5 steps\n- [[Growing areas 産地]]\n- [[Cultivar 品種]]\n- [[Cultivation methods 栽培方法]]\n- [[Harvesting methods 収穫方法]]\n- [[Processing method 製茶方法]]\n\n## Cultivars\n[[200 Cultivar 品種 MOC]]\n\n\n## Tea Components\n[[200 Tea Components MOC]]\n\n## Brewing\n[[Brewing factors]]\n\n\n## Courses\n[[100 Foundation Course MOC]]\n[[200 Intermediate Course MOC]]\n\n## Tea ceremony schools\n[[Enshu School # 遠州流茶道]]\n\n## Books\n[[300 日本茶のすべてが分かる本 MOC]]\n\n## [[Storage of tea]]\n\n\n\n## [[100 Important figures MOC]]\n\n\nKeihanchaen 畦畔茶園 , the tea bush surrounds the house\n\n---\n# References\n[JA website](https://www.zennoh.or.jp/bu/nousan/tea/dekiru03.htm)\n[Japanese cultivar list](https://chakatsu.com/basic/ocha_hinshu/)\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #MOC\nZettelkasten UID: 202208101955\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/000-Tea-MOC":{"title":"000 Tea MOC","content":"\n[[000 Japanese Tea MOC]]\n[[Comodity Tea \u0026 Specialty Tea]]\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #MOC\nZettelkasten UID: 202208271541\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/100-Foundation-Course-MOC":{"title":"100 Foundation Course MOc","content":"\n[[100 History of the Japanese Tea]]\n[[200 Tea Components MOC]]\n[[Storage of tea]]\n[[Genmaicha 玄米茶]]\n[[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]]\n[[Sencha 煎茶]]\n[[Gyokuro 玉露茶]]\n[[Matcha 抹茶]]\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #MOC\nZettelkasten UID: 202210151457\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/100-History-of-the-Japanese-Tea":{"title":"100 History of the Japanese Tea","content":"Status: 🌱\n# History of the Japanese Tea\nFollowing is what we know from Tea in Japan, how it arrived, was grown and drink, and eventually diverged from the Chinese Tea Culture onto it own.\n\n## Chronology of Tea in Japan\n\n\n## Ancient times (China)\n\n~BC 2800, Shennong 神農, the divine farmer legend of cataloging wild plants and herbs.

It descrives buying tea, boiling water and preparing the utenils as tasks to be performed by Bian Liao. It also shows how the tea was starting to be enjoied by the upper class in Chinese society at that time.\n\n~AD 760 Tang Dinasty 618-907 [[The Classic of Tea 茶経]]is published by Lu Yu 陸羽\n\n## 弥生時代　BC300 - AD300\n239 Himiko 卑弥呼 the shaman queen reings, Japan is mentioned in \"records of the Three Kindgoms\"\n\n## Asuka period 飛鳥時代　550~710\n~538 Emperor Kimmei 欽明天皇 reigns, good relationships with the kingdom of Baekje (Korea) reigned by  King Song Myong (聖明王,Seimeiou in Japanese). Buddism is introduced to Japan.\n\n### 9th century \nTea was introduced into Japan by Buddhist monks travelling to China. On their way back they brought tea with them as they grow used to drink it while in China an during meditation sessions. The two monks we have knowledge of are, Saicho that introduced around Kyoto. And Kukai, that did into Wakayama.\n\nThis first introduction was tea most probably in powder form that they brought. It was introduced into the temples but nothing more happened for a few hundred years.\n\n### 12th Century\n1190's with monk Eisai was the real \"start\" of Tea in Japan. Some might say that the tree was already there and was not first introduced from the outside. But there is no way to know. Others argue that the tea was there already but people did not know about it's properties until later on. \n\n## Miyoe monk\n\n[[Eisai]] brought not only tea but also seeds, those where planted in an Island in the region of 長崎 Nagasaki, 佐賀 Saga located in 九州 Kyushu island and in 京都 Kyoto as well.\n\nEisai not only did that but also wrote the [[Kissa Yojoki]] a book about the benefits of drinks for health, and Eisai recommend tea, as well as Mulberry infusion.\n\n1269 Chabustusan, a book about tea-ware published in China but with illustrations depicting the mills for grounding tea, one similar to the traditional one for Matcha as wells a more common one for medicinal herbs or spices. There is as well others like a whisk. 800 years ago tea in powder form [[Matcha 抹茶]] was already there, produced and consumed but, the shading techniques where not yet invented.\n\nSo we can see that the tea was ground, added with water int a bowl and whisked just like matcha today but without the shading. 茶色 gives a hint on the original type of tea at that time as it means brown colour. So probably the colour of the powder tea consumed at that time was brown and very different from the [[Matcha 抹茶]] we are used now.\n\n### 13th Century\nTea as medicine is the main topic and use.\n\n### 14th - 15th Century\n茶香服 Chakabuki, a game consisting on tasting blindly several bowls, 9 or 11 of teas and guess which one is the \"real tea\", the one grown in Kyoto. The tea was something similar to [[Matcha 抹茶]] and there used to be gambling involved eventually. The gambling was eventually prohibited although never very much enforced.\n\n### 15th -16th Century\n1580's some parts of the society, specially in the temples saw the getting out of the temples into the palaces and lavish tea parties. This part of society tried to bring it back to the ceremonial root s of the origins. The most well know actor in this movement was Sen no Rikyu. He was not the first one to start the movement but he codified and written the practice that eventually derived into the main 3 schools of tea ceremony and the others as well.\n\n1650's is the start of the loose-leaf tea in japan, thanks to Ingen monk. Ingen was a monk from china coming to Japan to build a temple in Kyoto, in Uji, the Manpukuji. In China originally they drink powder tea, until that time Japan used to consume it in the same powder form. Ingen became the first one to bring the new way that was already in China into Japan. Farmers then started to develop news techniques more suited for this new method of brewing. This tea was probably something similar to [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]] as the [[Pan-fired teas]] was the method used in China and Japan still hadn't developed the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] production methods.\n\nSomewhere around the 15 and 16th Century shading is used to protect the crops from the cold weather and frost. By the 18th Century it was widely used in [[Matcha 抹茶]] and later in [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] production as well. A change in flavour on the places were this shading was used was the primer for shading the tea, making the final product more sweet and pleasant.\n\nAround 1735 [[Baisao 売茶翁]] is serving tea in leaf form, as he learned in the monastery he was a monk in, as a tea peddler around the city of Kyoto. By 1738 his brewing style was more common and popular and the years leading to that fruited in to the experimentation by the tea farmers to create the loose leaf tea version of Japan.\n\nIn 1738 Nagatani Souen in Uji, invented a new production method that is the base for modern tea production in Japan, at that time [[Sencha 煎茶]]. And eventually all the other teas as well. The method included the use of [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] done by hand in a paper covered table. \n\nIn 1835 came the invention of [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], mainly by change. At that time [[Matcha 抹茶]] powder was still the main tea, and [[Japanese tea shading techniques]] were used. The producers where prompted to try create a loose-leaf tea out of the shaded leafs as well and thus creating the [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]]. That was then moved to the capital Tokyo and it became a hit.\n\n1884 Japan was \"forced\" to open borders and tea was already expanded and consumed around the world in many countries. Japan decided to export it's tea production as well. For this they created the [[Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association 公益社団法人日本茶業中央会]] was created, to boost exports and still exists today.\n\n1885 Kenzo Takabayashi, a medical doctor, observing that the tea production was still 100% done by hand, created the Sencha processing machine. The principles on how it works still apply in most part in modern machines. This machine helped produce more quantity. Also provide a way to compete better in the export trends after the borders i Japan opened after 1884.\n\n1904 [[Yabukita やぶきた]] Cultivar is registered. By Hikosaburo Sugiyama which would become and still is the most used cultivar in Japan.\n\n1915 Tea shears are adopted as a [[Harvesting methods 収穫方法]] to improve harvest quantities.\n\n1955 The first tea harvesting machine is introduced, singe person handled. Later on a battery would be added in 1962\n\n1965 Two person harvesting machine. Can harvest up to 300-400kg per day with only 2-3 persons.\n\n1971 Driven harvesting machines are introduced for more industrialised gardens in flat areas. Allows around 1 ton or more to be harvested per day.\n\n1984 Worlds first canned green tea is introduced and later one substituted by the plastic bottle green tea in 1990. Both of them by Ito En, the biggest tea brand in the world.\n\n1999 The Japanese tea instructor program is born. The idea being that if you train people in tea they will come back to the tea pots as an exploration.\n\n2015 Japanese Tea Export promotion council. Exports were going and the government wanted to support and grow the exports.\n\n2019 GJTA is born.\n\n\n\n---\n# References\nhttps://yunomi.life/blogs/ocha/baisao-the-first-tea-master\n[[100 Foundation Course MOC]]\n[[Harvesting methods 収穫方法]]\n[[300 日本茶のすべてが分かる本 MOC]]\n\nhttps://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/JapanDynasties.htm\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202210061831\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/100-Important-figures-MOC":{"title":"100 Important figures MOC","content":"[[Nagatani Souen]]\n[[Baisao 売茶翁]]\n[[Eisai]]\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #MOC\nZettelkasten UID: 202212131935\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/200-Cultivar-%E5%93%81%E7%A8%AE-MOC":{"title":"100 Cultivar 品種 MOC","content":"# Cultivar list of Japanese tea \n\nCultivars are variations or mutations of the Sinensis species that show a desirable trait like frost resistance or particular aromas in the cup.

Most of the compound's effects, characteristics, and interaction with one another are not known. Some of the more well known are the ones responsible for the characteristically smells of tea. \n\nIn the case of green tea, a grassy aroma known as 青葉アルコール (あおば) or leaf alcohol, is the responsible for the cut grass, green smell. This is also present together with other compounds in the characteristic aroma of fresh cut tea and [[Shincha 新茶]]. This grassy smell is usually reduced or thoroughly removed once the steaming is applied to the leafs. [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]], usually do not present this grassy smell negatively, usually transformed into a more sweet version. \n\nOther compounds like Pirazin appears once a roasted element or process is applied. like in [[Sencha 煎茶]] or [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]]. The balance between the leaf alcohol grassy aroma and the one from the roasted  from pirazin is very important. It helps determine some qualities of the tea and the intensity of the \"branding\" if present and in what degree. The pirazin compound is very present in teas like [[Bancha 番茶]]and [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] as the roasting process is more intense.\n\nOn high grade Sencha and [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] there is prevalence of another compound, linked to the smell of Nori, a kind of sea weed. The compound is Dimethyl Sulphide and gives the tea the characteristic seaweed smell.\n\nThe are many other compounds that provide specific aromas and/or flavours. Some of the most prominent or interesting ones are: \n\n\noooooo\n\n\n## Differences in aromas depending on the processing\nIndependently of the process the leaves go trough to become a final product, the initial leaf material is the same, be it different grades of Green tea, [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] or [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]].\n\nThe characteristics in everyone of the different processes imbues the final product with series of compounds characteristics of them. In Green teas we have seen that leaf alcohol and pirazin or Dimethyl sulphide balance define a big part of the tea. This is also amplified due to the short time the leaf is left unprocessed or withered, which in the case of Japan tends to be almost 0 change to wither. This helps preserve the original state of the leaf and it \"green, fresh\" characteristics. After that depending on what processing is applied, [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] or [[Pan-fired teas]]. The compounds composition is altered in very different ways.\n\nFor [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]], also know as semi-oxidised (or semi-feremted in some literature) teas, or [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]], known as fully-oxidised. Withering is a key component of the process thus affecting in a great extend the aroma profile and composition of the tea. Black tea can usually present rose or other fruit related smells, Oolongs can present from flower and fruits to other more complex combinations. This is in part dependant on the oolong quality but also the amount of oxidation applied.\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[日本茶のすべてが分かる本]]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72495-5\n\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202209152021\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Baisao-%E5%A3%B2%E8%8C%B6%E7%BF%81":{"title":"Baisao","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Baisao\nWas a monk living in the Edo period (1603 - 1868) between the 1675 and 1763 when he passed away un the city of Kyoto.

There are two main components that give the brew their appearance. \n\nIn the case of [[Sencha 煎茶]] the flavonoids are the main component that results in a yellow brew. This yellow can be more of muted tones almost brownish due to oxidation in lower grade teas. See [[Green colour preservation]]. Or mor bright color in higher grades. The green suspended particles or tint color present in the brew comes from the chlorophyll itself.\n\nIn deep steam tea the color is more of a bright green and usually with more suspended powder in the brew as well. Looking more like  turbulent tea, this is not a bad indicator for deep steamed teas as the leaf becomes very soft and easely crumbles durign the processign stage. See [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]].\n\nA red tint or stain might be present in some brews, this is caused due to the catechins present in the drink. This is usually present due to the degradation of the chlorophyll via heat, light or oxygen exposure. This is considered a sign of a lower grade tea as the [[Processing method 製茶方法]] or the [[Green colour preservation]] has not been expertly achieved. \n\nThis is not a bad trait in [[Bancha 番茶]] or [[Pan-fired teas]] like  [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]] where the application of heat durning either the Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい) or the Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい) makes the catechins to oxidise to some degree. It is a similar case for [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] where the application of heat for the roasting also producess a similar effect among the roast development.\n\nA brigth red colour is a characeristic trait of [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] as this are fully oxidised. In [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] the brew will look more yellow if it's lightly oxidised or more redish is more oxidised.

The price is usually in currency/Kg.\n\nMost of the famous tea beverages in cultures around the world (English Breakfast, Moroccan Mint, etc) are based in bulk commodity tea as they are very extended in their consumption.\n\nThere is however a large amount of high quality tea called specialty tea. Teas that have greater quality characteristics. These teas can also be found in blends for the drinks like English Breakfast, but prices and also qualities are completely different then. \n\n## Quality factors\n### Leaf format\nLeaf format might be one of the biggest factor and it's very linked with the processing methods used. Generally, the smaller the leaf the lower the quality, higher teas being made up of full leaves or more than one, buds too.\n### Infusion \nTea is water used to extract the soluble solids in the tea leaf.  Resulting in a 2% of compounds from the leaves in the water. The soluble solids can be generalised depending on the type of tea used. As well as surface area of the tea, chemical properties of the water, atmospheric pressure, water temperature and infusion time. \n\nSee [[Steeping]] and [[Soluble solids in Tea leaves]]\n\n### Type of tea\nIt is the key component as it determines what soluble solids are in the leaves. The types of tea are defined by the [[Tea processing type]]. Same process will give a similar components in the leaves. All tea types share major chemical components: polyphenols, amino acids, enzymes, pigments, carbohydrates, alkaloids, minerals, volatile compounds. And those affect the taste, color, body and smell of the cup. \n\nHow much of the components end up in the cup depends in the surface area of the tea leaf, the properties of the water, atmospheric pressure, water temperature and infusion time\n\n### Surface area \nThe more area exposed the more the rate of dissolution is increased. The same mass of different tea have big variations of surface area exposed. Adding full leaf tea with low surface area also increases the rate of dissolution.\n\n## [[Chemical properties of water]]\nThe ability of water to extract the solid compounds from the leaf is aided or impeded by: pH levels, hardness levels and mineral levels.\n\npH should be between 6.5 to 8.5, standard levels for drinking water. Lower pH will be more acidic and lighter infusion and higher pH more alkaline darker infusion.\n\nWater hardness is Magnesium and Calcium dissolved in the water. Being temporary or permanent, referring to Magnesium/Calcium Bicarbonates or Carbonates respectively. Temporary hardness can dull the color of the tea and promote the creation of scum. \n\nPolyphenols bind to this minerals during the extraction of the flavours. To high levels of minerals will result in a metallic taste while too low in an empty, dull flavour. TDS meters are a way to know the levels of minerals but not the composition of them.\n\n## Atmospheric pressure\nAt sea level (+- 14,7 psi) boiling point is 100ºC. Higher altitudes, pressure is lower and boils under 100ºC. You can use vacum to infuse tea at temperatures well below 100ºC.\n\n## Water temperature.\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202205231648\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Cultivar-%E5%93%81%E7%A8%AE":{"title":"cultivar 品種","content":"Status: 🌱\n\n\nEvery varietal cultivar affects the following:\n\n品種特製\n・Taste 味\n・Smell 香り\n・amount and time of harvest 収穫量と収穫時期\n- Diseases and cold resistance 病気・病気・寒さへの抵抗性\n\n[[Yabukita やぶきた]] is the most cultivated one currently at 70%, the second one is [[Yutakamidori ゆたかみどり]]] at 6%.\n\nCultivars that have not been breed in other words the indigenous species, thus being the original material are called [[Zairai 在来種]].

This deactivates the oxidase reduction reaction. In Japanese this process is know as 殺青 (さっせい) or kill-green. This process once completed prevents further oxidation and mantains the characteristic green color for green teas. This process is of course used in the [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] and [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] tea production to produce fully oxidise or semi-oxidised teas.\n\nHowever during the processing heat, light and air exposure can gradually continue the reaction.

Currently this method is only used for competition grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or ceremonial grade [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]]. It is done manually by plucking 摘菜 (てきさい) an specific amount of leafs depending on the tea that is going to be produced. It can range from 1 bud and 2 leafs 一芯二葉 (いちしんによう) to 1 bud and 5 leaves 一芯五葉 (いっしんごよう). \n\nUsually the bud and the 2  first leafs are used for [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]],[[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] and other higher grade teas. Anything below that is used in [[Bancha 番茶]] and other lower grade teas, like [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] as well.\n\nThere are as well different techniques on how these amounts are harvested from the bush:\n- Bending 折り摘み (おりづみ) \n- Pulling しごき摘み\n- Plucking かき摘み\n\nThis techniques determine as well the amounts of tea leaves that can be harvested in a day, as it is very time and labour consuming. But, it also determines the quality of the selected leaves and the damage that they sustain during the harvest.\n\n### Tea shears 手鋏\nAnother hand harvesting method was introduced in 1915, with the handheld shears 手鋏 (てばさみ). They are similar to the one used for pruning trees or bushes today. Attached to the shears there is a cloth pouch where the leaves are deposited after cutting. This provided a huge boost to productivity by around 6 to 8 times compared to hand harvesting.\n\n## Machine harvesting 機械摘み\nThere are two main methods for machine harvesting, handheld machines 可搬式摘採機 (かはんしきてきさいき) or driven machines 乗用摘採機 (じょうようてきさいき).\n\nHandheld machines were introduced in the 1950s and allow 1 or 2 people to harvest very efficiently, sometimes 3 people are used as well. This machines where the natural evolution of the scissors 手挟み (てばさみ) used in harvesting that substituted the hand harvesting methods. \n\n###  1 person harvesting machine\nIn the Showa era 昭和30 (1955) the first single person handheld machine was introduced. It was first hand operated to revolve a drum with blades that cut the leafs, similar to a bush trimmer, but manually. Later on in 1962 a battery was added making it more efficient and easy to use. compared to hand picking it was 19 times more efficient and compared to the shears around 1.8 times. \n\nDue to the weight and the even the battery powered one can be tricky to held and keep in level when cutting over the tea bushes so it has been replaced by the 2 person variant.\n\n### 2 persons harvesting machine\nIn the Showa era 昭和40 (1965) the first 2 person handheld harvesting machine was developed. It is held by 2 persons one on each side of the tea bush, placing the cutting bladed at the desired height. When walking alongside the tea rows the tea leaf is harvested and stored in a bag that is being carried along. \n\nSometimes a third person is in charge of holding the bag as this machine can harvest significantly more quantity than the previous methods. It's productivity can go up 60 times compared to hand picking, allowing up to 300-400 kg of leaves to be harvested with only 2-3 people.\n\nThis machines are very common method for harvesting in small garden or gardens situated in hill and mountain environments. Places where the driven versions of this cutter cannot be used. One of the disadvantages is that both operators have to sync very well to maintain the machine levelled and at the harvesting height that is desired. This creates of course some mixed harvesting as some coarser leafs will be harvested as well. Creating the need to sort them out in the [[Processing method 製茶方法#Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい) |shiage sorting process]] \n\n### Driven harvesting machines\nThis can be operated by 1 or 2 persons, as a basic explanation imagine the handheld harvester machine placed on wheels or threads. Then a person on top is in charge of driving the machine along the tea rows at the desired height. This machines are capable of harvesting around 1 ton or more per day. They are very productive and very common in flatlands where the fields stretch for several hectares. They have a high cost so they are commonly used within cooperatives or large tea garden in flatlands.\n\nAs with the [[#2 persons harvesting machine]] the irregularities in the terrain, or the height setting of the machine on each segment of the field can end up with a mixed harvest. This will include coarser leaves that will need to be sorted out later. \n\nSome driving machines can be operated by a single person and unload the leaves into a container or bags that can later load on a van and be transported to the factory.\n\n### Automatic harvesting machines\nThis machines are somewhat similar to the driven harvesting machines with some key differences. First, they are usually automatic in the sense that do not require a driver. This is because they are set on top of rails installed along the tea bushes. The rails help considerably when it comes to overcome the irregularities of the terrain. \n\nSecondly, this machines can be very precisely set to a height that will be constant in the whole length of the rails. This helps to achieve harvested material similar to hand [[#Hand harvesting 手摘み]] methods. This machines can be used before harvest as pruning, then the height is logged. When it is time to harvest the field can be levelled to the old measure to know where the new shots are located.\n\nThis require more infrastructure than any other method but provides an automatic and good quality harvest material.\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n[GJTA Sencha video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXlz5fg1RKU\u0026t=14s)\n[[The Story of Japanese Tea]]\n[[The Forefront of Mechanization in Tea Industry.pdf]]\n[[日本茶のすべてが分かる本]]\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202208271543\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.366354047Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Hojicha-%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%98%E8%8C%B6%E7%84%99%E3%81%98%E8%8C%B6":{"title":"Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶\nLower grade tea, usually made from [[Bancha 番茶]] that has been roasted. \n\n\n---\n# References\n[[100 Foundation Course MOC]]\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202210151730\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Japan-Tea-Distribution":{"title":"Japan Tea Distribution","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Japan Tea Distribution\nThe three main actors are the growers, processors and the distributors. Although not every region has the same structures we can identify three main routes of distribution. Distribution of raw leaf, distribution of [[Processing method 製茶方法#Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい)| crude tea Aracha]] and distribution of [[Processing method 製茶方法#Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい)|refined tea Shiagecha]].\n\nThe raw leaf is processed into Aracha from the growers or cooperatives by the a producer organizatiopn, although there are many cases where this individual producers or cooperatives have their own facilites as well. \n\nThe crude tea is  then gathered trough the tea market or trough cooperatives and refined, blended etc.　Some regions like Shizuoka and Kyoto have a ong tradition as producing areas. On top of that they hold large distribution centers where they gather not only crude tea or refined tea from that region but from other famous producing regions as well. \n\nThis large distribution centers gathered as well processign facilities for refined tea as well as brokers, packing companies and machine manufacturers.　\n\nThen trough the wholesales is distribute to the small shops, department stores etc. The traceability for the producer, manufacturer is a key aspect so can be maintained until it reaches the final consumer.  \n\n## Information about the components\nIn order to not loose information about the product there are strict regulations about the information that need to be showed in the packaging.\n\nIn 1999 (Heisei 11) the JAS law was modified to include tea as a processed food. This means that tea product labels had to state a list of items in order to be sold. This include:\n- Name\n- List of ingredients\n- net content \n- expiration date\n- Conservation methods\n- country of origin\n- importer name\n- manufacturer or seller name\nIn addition all the raw ingredients countries have to be stated as well.\n\nThere is some optional information like:\n- Concrete tea species\n- Cultivar name\n- Land or location of growing name\n- Company name\n- Packaging type\n- Handling precautions\nFor organic products JAS also regulates labelling:\n- Organically grown and organically processed products\n- Specially grown agricultural products\n\nDue to some labelling fraud and to improve the reliability of the product another set of labelling standar was created in 2004  (heisei 16) by the [[ Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association 公益社団法人日本茶業中央会]]  to establish a code of conduct for the industry to comply.\nThis makes the information that need to be on the label very precise, only being able to stipulate that a tea is Kyoto tea if the contents are 100% from Kyoto, for example.\n\n## Tea related laws\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[日本茶のすべてが分かる本]]\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202211061500\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Japanese-Black-Tea-%E5%92%8C%E7%B4%85%E8%8C%B6":{"title":"Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶\n\nBlack tea, mostly experimental at this point, but with a new push for developing it due to the drop in price for green tea over the last years. \n\nSeveral harvests seasons, with whitering rolling and drying stages.

This preference, together with a desire to reduce the bitterness of the the brew, developed in cultivation techniques that boost the sweetness and lowers the bitterness. Mimicking the natural shade that the tea bushes might get when grow in forested areas, shading techniques were developed to shade the bushes were natural shading was not possible, like in the modern flat tea plantations of today.\n\nThe main cause that creates a different flavour profile is that the limited sun exposure for the photosynthesis of the leafs prevents the amino acids like [[L-Theanine]] to turn into [[Catechin]]. This is a desirable trait in high grade teas like [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] to form a sweeter more umami cup. The tea leaves harvested via this shading technique tend to be softer, thinner and tends to stretch for sunlight. Typical cover is 85~90% but depends on the type of tea, region and time that is going to be shaded.\n\nThe shading techniques have evolved from the old origins into a cheaper and less labor intensive for the farmer. Also, they have been adopted for teas that traditionally grow unshaded, to boost the umami flavour in the cup. Examples of this are shaded [[Sencha 煎茶]], known as 被せ茶・被せん茶.\n\n## Shading methods\nThere are to diferent shading methods depending on how they are applied or build into the field. 棚がけ (shelf-style) or 直がけ (direct application style)\n\n### Straw cover honzuhifuku \nIs perhaps the most similar to the old shading methods, and it’s mainly used for [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] and [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] production. It is a shading that is applied like a canopy on top of a wooden, stone or metal structure using mainly two different kinds of materials. A bamboo screen 葦簀 is laid first to create a shading for the initial 7-10 days over the teas, blocking 50-60% of the sunlight. After that rice straw 稲藁 is spread on top of the bamboo screen blocking up to 98% of the sunlight for the remaining time of the shading process until the leaf material is harvested. \n\nSome farmers prefer this method as the natural material can also create a pleasant aura in the shaded tea leafs and help absorb humidity present during the shading state. (See Kuma farmer from Yame interview from the Japanese tea marathon.) It is overall a more labor intensive process and the rice straw needs to be purchased and spread by hand, same for the bamboo screen although that can be reused. The rice straws can also be later used as a natural fertiliser for the bushes.\n\nIn some high grade teas that use this shading technique together with other traditional techniques for the harvesting and processing can be found labeled as 本玉露.\n\n### Cheesecloth cover 寒冷紗\nThe newer, more economical and less labor intensive shading technique derived from the [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]]. Uses a synthetic material as a cover instead of bamboo or rice. The main differences would be the more cheap and reusable material. Easy installation and ease of use, remove or layer on top of another shade to regulate the amount of sunlight. Some of the structures used with this covers can be permanent metal bars were the covers can be put on or off with ease. Similar to a greenhouse this ease of use can also be used to regulate temperature as a protection or for other applications as well.\n\n#### Double layer cover 棚型二段被覆\nThis method is very similar to the [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]], a first layer is spread on a shelf structure regulation the sunlight for the first half of the shading process. Then at around 7-10 days another layer of the synthetic cover is laid on top of the first one. The final shading amount is virtually the same, up to 98% and the only real diferences is the ease of instalation fro the farmer. \n\nThis method does not provide a natural added fertilizer like the rice straw once removed, and altough the shading happens the straw and bamboo efect is not transmitted into the leafs. High grade competition tea are usually shaded with the more [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]] method and the rest of high grade for main consumption are shaded using this Double layer method.\n\n#### Tunnel cover トンネル被覆\nIt is a technique similar to the shelf-like strucure for the [[#Double layer cover]], in this case though the shading is laid on top of removable metal arcs. This allows to shade the sides of the tea bush as well with the same cover. It is a method common for Kabusecha. This method is not as comon as [[#Direct blanketing]]. Due to the added work of building the arc structure before covering the bushes. It provides a more easier environment for the leaves to grow and fro the air and humidity to move around the structure unlike the [[#Direct blanketing]]. \n\n#### Direct blanketing 直接被覆\nThe shades are applied directly on top of the bushes, covering the sides as well. This is probably the most easy way to install and remove the shades. It is part of the iconic Japanese tea field image of aligned bushes rows. This metjod is usually applied for [[Sencha 煎茶]] and Kabusecha as does not allow to the humidity and air to move as easy as other methods. It can also be found in lower grades of [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] . Blanketing directly also means that the material is in direct contact with the newly grown leafs, creating a friction for the growth as the shoot upwards. if the shade is tensed on the bushes it could be counterproductive for their grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[The Story of Japanese Tea]]\n[Ooika shading article](https://ooika.co/learn/tea-shading)\n[[Tea Shading techniques manual.pdf]]\n[Green Tea Merchant](https://www.shizuokatea.com/blog/covering-process-of-japanese-tea-plants/)\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202208191207\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Kabusecha-%E8%A2%AB%E3%81%9B%E7%85%8E%E8%8C%B6%E8%A2%AB%E3%81%9B%E8%8C%B6":{"title":"Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶\nHigh grade loose-leaf tea, made with buds and young leafs.

Kagoshima is a relative flatland along its coast, which allows for big scaled operations to take place and as well the weather is quite mild and humid. With not super hot summers or very cold winters, allowing for a longer window for harvesting.\n\nKagoshima sea coastline is quite low altitude, for example Kirishima at around 300 meters of altitude is considered a \"mountain\" grown tea. This gives Kagoshima a bit less variations on the flavour profiles that can be found. Kagoshima though have a few islands like Tanegashima and Yakushima, which gives a bit of a different profile than cannot be found in other regions. As they have a more tropical weather not found in the bigger islands or mainlands.\n\nThe development into growing tea is not very well known, and it seems it is very recent compared to other regions, dating back to the 19th century. In specific, after the 2nd world war. Its beginnings as well are in the black tea production, which did not hold up as other regions were growing it way cheaper when Japan open up for trade. \n\nTea is very extended and can be usually found next to other important infrastructures like airports, villages and other infrastructure.\n\nOne of the famous places comes from the historical developments from the airports in World War 2, with the well-known Kamikaze pilots from the Chiran Kamikaze airport, one of the biggest airports. This military spaces were torn apart and big areas became tea fields later on as it was very good flat land for it.\n\nKagoshima also has a lot of active volcanos, biggest add to the soil composition and the ashes that they provide, one of the biggest and most active one is the Sakurajima volcano. This has a drawback that tea leafs need to be washed prior to processing to remove the ashes. This is not well documented or investigated, but it is tough that this washing step makes the tea milder, as it might remove or wash out part of the compound in the tea leafs.\n\n95% of the land is harvested with driven machine and the factories are quite large too. A later development of Kagoshima as tea producer and specially after ww2 where the machinery was already more common and more developed allowed for a better planning and a better infrastructure that could be scaled up in the future.\n\nTeas being make are kind o fsimilar to [[Shizuoka 静岡]] with [[Sencha 煎茶]] and [[Fukamushi 深蒸し]] tea being very common. An interesign fact was that due to the later development into a tea producing region and the lack of a strong recognisable brand around it like in Uji or Kyoto, a lot of tea was sent to Shizuoka as bulk or filler tea. Due to a less expensve tea, it copuld be mixced and sell as Shizuoka tea. That is until brands were developent and stregthen like the one of Chiran.\n\nNow they also have their own market for auctions and have several strong brands associated with the region an the rest of the areas as well.\n\nA particularity of Kagoshima is the prevalence of organic farming being very well regarded. I accounts 41% of the organic farmland in Japan, With shizuoka being in the second spot at 18% and Miyazaki at 11%. \n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202212041808\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Kamairicha-%E9%87%9C%E7%82%92%E3%82%8A%E8%8C%B6":{"title":"Kamairicha  釜炒り茶","content":"Status: 🌱\n\n釜炒り茶 (Kamairicha) is composed of Kama (釜), (iron pot, pan, cauldron) and 炒り (fry, roast, parch). Also, can be seen labelled as Kamaguri 釜ぐり.\n\n釜炒り茶 is then a pan fired tea, in contrast with the usual process of steamed teas that make up the bulk of the production in Japan commonly. It's a process believed to originate In China, where it is still being used, and can also be seen in some Korean teas as well. It was introduced trough Kyushu, and it has remained as a regional speciality. Once it was the original main method of processing tea before the invention of the steaming method in Kyoto, that spread farther out and became prevalent quickly. The steamed version of [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] tried to simulate the Kamairicha process at the beginning and thus both versions remain possible to be found.\n\nIn contrast to the more common types of green teas in Japan, leaves manufactured as Kamairicha are not rolled in needle shape, but left to be curled and twisted. Giving the appearance of a lesser tea, but that is not the case at all. The production is found mainly in Kyushu where this kind of processing of the leaves is thought that was introduced first, from mainland China. \n\nIt remained in the island without expaning too much, in the actual times [[Miyazaki 宮崎]] produces 38% of the total production The neighboriung regions add up to a total of 99% production voulme for this tea in Japan.

And the Aoyagi Style 青柳製, common in Kumamoto and Miyazaki. The Ureshino Style presents a 45º inclination of the firing pan, while the Aoyagi is kept parallel to the floor.\n\nFactory machines can be used, using a mechanical pan to stop the oxidation (known as kill-green). Then rolling of the leafs in a circular motion machine that presses the leaves together and helps break the cellular structure of the tea.

The south centre is more mountainous.\n\nTea started in the 13th century, was quite early, with a monk bringing seeds from China. For a while until 150 years ago, Mie was the highest producing region for tea in Japan, until the rise of [[Shizuoka 静岡]] as the biggest producer.\n\nUnique features is the presence of famous pottery style [[Bankoyaki]] one of the main styles for Kyushu teapots. Together with [[Tokoname]]. Pottery from this area is famously rich in iron so but due to low oxygen firing ovens, the iron in the pots cannot oxidize to red as with other firing techniques. So it ends with a more brownish metallic aspect.\n\nThe flatlands are the main are of production from Mie, still a bit of hills not full flat but still able to use driven machines.\n\nThey are most known for [[Sencha 煎茶]] as many other regions, but commonly used before as a filler tea for the Kyoto tea region market. Due to the drop in price and the necessity to boost the local production and brand, they started cultivation and created the [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] tea. A shaded tea that is not as long shaded as [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] but not sun grown like [[Sencha 煎茶]]. \n\nThis tea developed about 20-30 years ago, it was promoted as Gyokuro that you can prepare with boiling water. Netto Gyokuro ネット玉露 neto means boiling water. Now, it is also recommended to cool down the water a bit for this kind of teas, but it was created to be a Gyokuro that you could brew more casually.\n\nMie holds around 68% of the production of Kabusecha with [[Fukuoka]] and [[Shizuoka 静岡]] at 7% after that.\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202212121841\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Miyazaki-%E5%AE%AE%E5%B4%8E":{"title":"Miyazaki 宮崎","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Miyazaki 宮崎\nincludes regions like:\n- Takachiho\n- Gokase\n- Kawaminami\n- Miyakonojo\n- Kushima\nAlthough it is neibourh with [[Kagoshima 鹿児島]] the spread of the farms is quite diferent.

The biggest producing area is the Miyakonojo.\n\nThis elevation does not mean step hills, as the whole terrain elevates quite uniformly in some areas, leaving some cultivation possible at high altitute. \n\nMiyazaki started in the 17th century.

The production of the tea itself and the refining of the final product. The first is the transformation of the harvested leaf into \"unrefined tea\" or 荒茶 (あらちゃ), later on the tea is sorted, blended, branded, etc to create the final \"refined tea\" or 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃ).\n\nThis two processes can be done traditionally by hand 手揉み製茶 or by machine 機械揉み製茶. Nowadays 99% of the tea is produced by machines, as the Traditional method is very labor intensive and produce very few tea. It is still practiced by conservation societies or groups and there are yearly competitions that showcase the hand process style.\n\n## Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい)\nThis process takes care to stop the oxidation process, then roll and dry the leafs. The main characteristics that are modified during this process are the taste, aroma and apparence of the tea.\n\nThe first step on the process is to stop the oxidation process that the leaf experiences after being harvested. This process is called 殺精 (さっせい) or \"kill-green\" and is done by heating the leaves above 70 degress, this deactivates the enzimes responsible for the oxidation process. It is a key part in preserving the golden or green colour of the tea, wich will turn reddish to brown as the oxidation preocess continues, ending up in a partially oxidised tea like [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] or [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]]. \n\nThis heating stage can be achieved in two ways, the most common way is using steam, 烝熱 (じょうねつ), which will then follow the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] processing techniques. This include the main bulk of the Japanese green teas, [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]], [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] and the steamed variant of the [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]]. The degree of steaming is regarded as light 淺蒸し, medium 普通蒸し, or deep 深蒸し , although there is no clear definition in what is each one of this categories, it is very dependant on the regions, culture, farmer etc. As a rule of thumb below 1 minute of steaming can be considered by many light 淺蒸し steaming. Above that 1 minute deep 深蒸し steaming. Medium steaming is a category used sometimes, but most time we talk of light or deep steaming.\n\nAnother way is by applying heat directly trough a heated pan/wok, it is a rare method in Japan but the default method in other countries like China or Korea, from where it is believed it arrived to Japan and became the first tea processing methods. Teas that are treated using this method follow the [[Pan-fired teas]] processing techniques. The teas produced by this method is the pan-fired variant of the [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]].\n\nAfter the 殺精 (さっせい), there is a series of rolling stages and a final drying, which crush the molecular structure of the leaf, help bring the humidity to the surface to dry and give the final needle shape. Check [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] for in-depth explanation of each rolling stage. In the case of [[Pan-fired teas]], or mainly the pan-fired version of [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] there is some rolling applied but no straightening of the leafs, thus maintaining the curled shape.\n\nAfter all this processes around 80% of the weight is lost due to the evaporation of the water in the leaf.\n\n## Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい)\nAltough Aracha tea is ready to be drinked, a Shiage or refining process takes care of refining the leaves, separating them by size or colour, blending to achieve a even profile, or \"branding\" the tea. Sometimes this process can be skipped, only apply some of the methods or only one of them. Most of the times this process is also done by wholesalers that buy from farmers and to their own refining to have their own blends with the particular characteristics that they are looking for their products.\n\nThis four processes can also be done enitrely by hand following traditional methods.\n\n### Sorting 選別 (せんべつ)\nThis is perhaps the easiest process to explain and apply. The aracha tea is graded to separate  leaves into different sizes, shapes or colour. The different grades are usually:\n- Final tea leaves 本茶 (ほんちゃ), it is the highest grade.\n- Stems 茎 (くき), stems from the leaves, used in [[Kukicha 茎茶]] and it's variants.\n- Heavy particles, 芽茶 (めちゃ) or めこ, made of broken coarse leaves.\n- Lighter particles, ほそこ　粉, made of fine more powdery particles.\n\n棒茶　粉茶\n\nThe sorting can be done by sieves, air or static electricity and color as well. This methods can be used in combination, in particular with color separation.\n\nSieves can spearate the leaves by vibration, wich usually spearates leaves by thickness or be rotating horizontally, which separate by length.\n\nAir separates by weigth as depending on the mass it will travel longer or shorter disctance. Ususally is used after sieveing, to separate leaves from stems or the diferent types of coarse leafs or broken leaves and powder.\n\nStatic electricity charges the leaves and this are send in diferent directions.\n\nColor sorter are able to find diferences in color on leaves of the same size and weight that might have gotten trough the other methods. I can be great to clean up the apparence of the final product and it provides a high fidelity separation ability\n\n\n\n### Cutting 切断 (せつだん)\nSorted leaves can be of the same thicknes when sorted out but still have diferent lengths. The leaves are just inserted into a machine that cuts the leaves to a predefined lengngth. This can also be applied to leaves that are bigger than the starndard 本茶 leaves to cut them into smaller pieces.\n\n### Firing 火入 (ひいれ)\nIt is the final process, that modifies the leafs itself. Heat is applied using, hot air, direct heat, infrared rays or even microwaves around 80Cº to 110Cº. This will give the aroma characteristic of firing without going as long as roasting tea leaves like in a [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] where it is usually over 130Cº. This process is also called branding and it is a step where the producer can \"brand\" their teas by using this heat and bring out a different more roasty, nutty aroma. This aroma is called 火香 (ひか).\n\n\n\n### Blending 合組 (ごうぐみ)\nThis process can be just blending again the different tea leaves sorted out during the Shiage process or blend only some part of it. It can also be blending different leaves from different farms, same farms but different varietals or the same ones as well. It all comes down to the product that one wants to create or maintain stable for the customers year after year. This creates balanced flavours that maybe some single tea could not achieve for example. Also works to combine the different products of the same farm to not waste any product and still offer an aprochable and inexpensive product for the consumer.\n\n\n## Production amounts per type\nIn 2019 the volume of tea produced in % was:\n- [[Sencha 煎茶]] ~54%\n- [[Bancha 番茶]] ~32%\n- [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] (shaded teas) ~4%\n- [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] 3%\n- Others 3%\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[The Story of Japanese Tea]]\n[[Japanese Tea - A comprehensive guide]]\n[GJTA Sencha video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXlz5fg1RKU\u0026t=14s)\nJapanese Association of Tea Producers 2019\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202208271651\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Production-amounts":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Saemidori-%E3%81%95%E3%81%88%E3%81%BF%E3%81%A9%E3%82%8A":{"title":"Saemidori さえみどり","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Saemidori さえみどり\n\n[[Kagoshima 鹿児島]] 1990, presents more [[Umami]], early shooting, good yield. \n\nVery promising cultivar, also good for [[Shaded teas 覆下栽培]].\n\nUsed [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]].\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[200 Intermediate Course MOC]]\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202212061919\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Sayamakaori-%E3%81%95%E3%82%84%E3%81%BE%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A":{"title":"Sayamakaori さやまかおり","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Sayamakaori さやまかおり\n\n2% of used cultivars.

There is of course mountain slopes and regions with a higher altitude where the tea is also produced in a more small scale but Shizuoka really is a high volume production regions. In here they have available a tea market for auctions and also factories of tea making equipment like \n\nThe shizuoka soil has an interesting mix as 4 tectonic plates come together in this regions. This showcase very differetn soil mixtures depending on the area the farm is located. This is a great point for this high volume region as it can showcse a variety of flavour profiles even though its volume production is very high and that is often seen as an obstacle for flavour profile diversity.\n\nShizuoka tea started in the 13th  century, just around 100 years after the introduction into Kyoto area by buddist monks. Ashikubo is regarded as the beggingn of the cultivation in shizuoka by the hand of the buddist monk Eni. At the beginning it was mainly on the mountain sites and it develped into the flatlands later on.\n\nFrom the Meiji restoration is when the production changed the most in the area, after the end of the isolation period. Lots of samurai class families became farmers and some became tea farmers, like the ones in Makinohara. Eventually Shizuoka would became the largest area for tea in this timeframe. \n\nThe history is quite far but the most expanded of production was around 150 years ago.\n\nShizuoka is know as an industrial place and also has be the birthplace of important historical developments like the [[Yabukita やぶきた]] cultivar in 1908 and the development of the handheld harvesting machine in 1965 and the later driven versions as well. \n\nA lot of manufacturing is present in Shizuoka, like Suzuki. As well as tea machinery makers like Kawasaki, Terada and -----.\n\nShizuoka was the initial region to focus in the growing of Japanese tea cultivars.\n\nThere is a tea museum recently renovated with regional and iternational tea, as well as ancient machines for tea manufacturing.\n\nShizuoka presents a lot of flatlands and it is the main areas where tea is grown at the present time. it is grown at scale with very big factories producing several tons a day.\n\nThere is also a small areas on the mountain where tea is also grown like Tenryu and Ashikubo. in very sloppy hills and above clouds altitude on those regions, presenting family operated farms as compared to the cooperatives in the flatlands.\n\nShizuoka specializes in [[Sencha 煎茶]] production and they are well known for the [[Fukamushi 深蒸し]] tea process, a more deep steam procces of the last 100 years. This was developed du to the growing conditions in the flatlands with a higher exposure to sunligth, the leafs grow coarser and thus the deep steam helps in the processing as well in the final flavor release and quality as well. It has become the major way to process tea there. \n\nThis kind of steaming makes the tea look much more vivid green and a nice flavour as well, so it has become very well regarded, specially in major urban areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202212041638\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Steamed-processed-teas-%E8%92%B8%E3%81%97%E8%A3%BD":{"title":"Steamed teas","content":"Status: 🌱\n\nBefore 1738 the production of tea was mainly [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]]. Which is a steamed and dried tea for matcha production. The process of rolling the leaf was invented by Nagatani Soen. Rolling the leafs creates a better release of flavours when infused. Several schools on hand-rolling techniques were born by the Tea masters (茶師), in 1905 a \"national\" style merging  several schools was established. \n\nMechanisation happened in two phases, first for the Steaming and initial rolling, being finished by hand. Later on other machines where developed for the more fine, dedicated rolling. Hand-rolling is maintained by some artisans, producing very small batches, usually for competition grade teas. Hand-rolling tea techniques are considered \"intangible national treasures\" by the Japanese government.\n\n## The Steam processing style\nUnlike other countries like China or Korea, Japan uses steam to stop the oxidation process post-harvest. Similar methods of [[Pan-fired teas]] can be found in Japanese teas as well. If the leafs are let to wither for too long it will show up in the tea, which traditionally happened due to the time it took to process the leafs by hand or simply by transportation from the field to the production facility. When the leaf becomes partially oxidised it is on it's way to be processed as a [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] or if fully oxidised to a [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]]. This two might be similar or not to other countries Oolongs or Black teas, but usually the taste profile is completely different.\n\nThis processing style is used in the main three types of Japanese green tea, and as a part of the process for others types as well. Thee \"big three\" are, [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]].\n\n### Steaming\nThe use heat to stop the oxidase enzyme is commonly know as kill-green (殺青). In the case of Japanese green teas steam is the main chosen type of heat.\n\nThe application of steam (烝熱) needs to be applied as soon as the leaf is harvested. The time needed is of at least 10 to 20 seconds. Both time and temperature are regulated by equipment  to be able to do a more controlled application of the heat. In the hand processing way, this was achieved by stacking bamboo trays on top of each other over a source of steam.\n\nDepending on the duration of the steaming process the final product can be classified as:\n- [[Asamushi 淺蒸し]], lightly steamed.\n- [[Futsuumushi 普通蒸し]], normal/regular steamed. \n- [[Fukamushi 深蒸し]], deeply steamed.\n\nGenerally speaking The shorter times preserve the flavour of the original product and the shape of the leaf as well. It usually translates into a more vigorous tea arome in the final tea.\nLonger times create a more mellow and richer body texture.\n\nFrom here on we can follow the [[#Hand production 手揉み茶]] or the [[#Mechanized production]]\n\n## Hand production 手揉み茶\n\n### Airing 茶振るい・葉振るい\nAfter the steaming the humidity of the leafs as well as the one added by the steam needs to be removed. This is true for residual heat that might still be present. For this the leafs can be moved around by tossing them into the air until they are dry. In the hand process a heated table is used to aid with the drying. \n\n### Kneading and rolling 回転揉み\nSmall amounts of leafs placed in the heated table are \"kneaded\" in a rotating motion while adding some pressure as well. Pressing the leafs will start to extracte the moisture in the leafs out. When there is moisture on the surface the process pivots to airing again until dry. This process is repeated until the inside moisture is gone and the leaf is dry.\n\nThe pressure also crushes the internal structure which translates into an easier release of its components when brewed.\n\n### Straightening 玉とき・玉解き\nProcess only found in the hand production of tea. After the kneading most of the leafs are curled up, the process is rudimentary yet is a very distinctive trait of a manual processed tes. Each leaves is picked, uncurled and straightened, one by one.\n\n### Final rolling 揉みきり\nThe leafs are rolled to shape them into needle shape, characteristic of the Japanese green teas. There are two main styles こくりstyle でんぐりstyle.\n\nThe heated table is turned down in this stage but due to the rolling of the leafs some drying still occurs, but the main process is still the shaping of the leafs. At this stage the tea is finished shape wise, although extra refining can be taken to further enhance the tea, mainly shape it into tighter thinner needles.\n\n### Itazuri 板ずり\nA wooden board is used to guide the needles into a certain direction, this board has horizontal groves helping achieve a thinner shape.\n\n### Final drying 乾燥\nAfter the final rolling the leaf is dryed further to around 5% humidity to improve the self life of the finished tea. This is done in drawers with a metal mesh to allow heat to circulate in a heated cabinet or oven.\n\nAt this stage 火入れ or \"branding\" is applied to the tea. This branding can be very noticeable or not depending on the producer or regionality traditions. It allows to the manufacturer to imprint the final product. A stronger branding will showcase more nutty flavours and a lighter one will preserve the original traits of the tea leaf.\n\n## Mechanized production\n\n### Airing 葉打ち・茶振るい \nSame way as for [[#Hand production 手揉み茶]] after the steaming the humidity of the leafs needs to be removed, and for any residual heat that might still be present. For this the leafs can be moved around by air in large series of vertical columns until they are dry. \n\n### Initial beating 粗揉 (そじゅう) Rough rolling\nThe leafs are inserted into a heated drum that moves around the leafs and dries them using hot air. At the same time the drum has spatulas in its axis that press the leafs against the wall of the drum. This process allows to move the sap and juices to the exterior were it can be removed thus initiating the drying of the leaf.\n\n### Kneading 揉捻 (じゅうねん)Twisting\nA ball of leaves is rolled in a circular motion against a horizontal embossed board with some downward pressure on the leafs. This stage corresponds to the [[#Kneading and rolling 回転揉み]] in the manual processing. The main purpose is to break the cellular structure for a better release of the compounds in the brew. Also some humidity will get extracted as well.\n\n### Agitation 中揉 (中揉) middle rolling \nSimilar to [[#Initial beating 粗揉 そじゅうそじゅう Rough rolling]], the leafs are inserted in a rolling drum equipped with kneading arms. This will press the leaves against the bamboo striped walls, rolling and untwisting the leafs, preparing them for the final rolling stage. At the same time hot air is injected to continue drying and reducing the humidity in the leaf. \n\n### Shaping 精揉 (せいじゅう) fine rolling\nThis process is the equivalent to [[#Final rolling 揉みきり]] in the hand processing method. It gives the leafs the final needle shape by brushing them back and forth against a bamboo rolling boars, similar in idea to the [[#Itazuri 板ずり]] board. During this stage hot air is still being used to keep drying the leaf.\n\n### Final drying 乾燥 (かんそう)\nEqual to the final drying in the hand process style, after the final rolling the leaf is dried further to around 5% humidity to improve the self life of the finished tea. This is done in drawers with a metal mesh to allow heat to circulate in a heated cabinet or oven.\n\nAt this stage 火入れ or \"branding\" is applied to the tea. This branding can be very noticeable or not depending on the producer or regionality traditions. It allows to the manufacturer to imprint the final product. A stronger branding will showcase more nutty flavours and a lighter one will preserve the original traits of the tea leaf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[The Story of Japanese Tea]]\n[[Japanese Tea - A comprehensive guide]]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qxIJgY-DY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0geWfdYLgE\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202208111803\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/Steamed-vs-pan-fired-teas":{"title":"Steamed vs pan-fired teas","content":"Status: 🌱\n# Steamed vs pan-fired teas\n[[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] teas have a stronger release of flavour at the beginning.

Its leaves are tiny, neatly rolled, cut needles with a nice deep green colour. The smell has hints of a ripe pineapple that struck me when I opened the bag. Some nutty background and noticeable fresh spinach leaves came afterwards.\n\n\n### 1st brew\n\nThe texture of this tea is always something that keeps captivating me, how such delicate, complex flavours melt together with this deep rich, coating textures. The flavour was light and enjoyable, smelling some tropical fruit ripeness in the wet leaves together with fresh spinach, such a combination.\n\nThe liquor had more presence of this fresh spinach notes, very subtle umami coming through, perhaps forecasting what was to come. The aftertaste of the brew left me with a coating on my tongue. Found myself indulging in it, delaying the next sip and allowing it to \"seep in\" all its nuance while listening to the occasional seagull passing by on this fresh, breezy morning.\n\n### 2nd brew\n\nI dropped the brewing time by a few seconds this time. Once the leaves are soaked, I find myself enjoying them more like this. The brew was noticeably brighter and greener, with a more profound smell coming from the leaves. Their aroma was sweeter, still with some fresh spinach notes, but developing other aromatics like herbs and some ripeness like a stone fruit.\n\nThe brew was taken over by more umami presence, with a surprising fresh minty/eucalyptus-like aftertaste. Lingering in the mouth and tingling my nose as I exhaled its vapours. These kinds of warm and refreshing notes were the ones that got me into \"drinking\" tea. I find this kind of tea, triggering sensations in the body, fascinating. As much as the body and flavour of the tea, the human body's reaction to it is a clear indication for me of what a great experience is.\n\n\n### 3rd brew\n\nThe refreshing aftertaste notes are still here, maybe moving toward being a part of the drink than the lingering finish of it. The liquor still maintains this soft bright green colour, the flavour is sweet, and it reminds me of a mochi sweet. It's not sugary or fruit sweet, but something more subtle. The aftertaste of the brew is clean, without astringency, but presenting subtle dark leafy green notes that add another layer on top of the present freshness.\n\n### 4rth brew\n\nFrom the fourth brew onwards, I tend to increase the brew times, increasing a couple of extra degrees to the water too. This time, even though the presence of umami is starting to wane, you can feel it lingering on the brew. It presents a very smooth body with a very pleasing texture. The freshness has moved to be fully present in the main flavour notes creating an interesting combination of smoothness, freshness, and some umami and dark leafy greens notes. \n\nI enjoyed this Sencha from Oku-Kirishima, one of the first-ever Japanese teas that I was introduced to me many years ago. And I am grateful to be able to enjoy it year after year.","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/post-prescription-only":{"title":"","content":"A morning brew - Kuura Prescription Only\nThis Sunday, I am enjoying a Sheng Pu-erh. Resin, herbal freshness and maybe a hint of pine needles welcome me after rinsing the leaves. I am brewing 6gr to 120ml today, perhaps not enough leaves, but starting to run out of this tea and want to enjoy it a little longer.\n\n### First brew\n\nThe first brew is of pale soft orange with some dust setting at the bottom as I approach the central, more compressed part of the cake. The tea leaves me with a slight coating in my mouth, ready for the next sip. Smooth in texture, notes of fresh herbals and flowers. Some fruitiness, like that of a stone fruit.\n\nThe tea was a farewell gift around three years ago when I left my job to study in Japan. It brings me lots of memories of those nearly six years working there.\n\n### Second brew\n\nThe leaves present themselves more in a nutty sense this time. The herbal notes are not present, taken over by a sweet, nutty smell with still some floral background.\n\nI love writing using fountain pens. I have realised just now that I am writing this with another farewell gift from a friend at my local pen club. (yes, those exist) It is a lovely Italian-made pocket pen inked with a dark lush green. Watching the ink slush inside the transparent reservoir has a calming and reflecting effect. It makes me think about all the things that happened in the past years.\n\nThe colour of the tea remains the same, perhaps a bit more bright, less cloudy, than before. The liquor is smooth, sweeter than before, with some flowers appearing in the background. More nut and creamy notes arise as the cup cools down, completing an enjoyable experience.\n\nI am not an expert in drinking Pu-erh, only recently diving into it. I purchased some teas from a vendor that recommended them as a good entry point to the Pu-erh experience. I look forward to cracking them open, enjoying them and comparing my experiences.\n\n### Third brew\n\nThe leaves haven't yet fully uncurl, and the brew looks a bit more golden yellow. Perhaps I really should have put more leaves into the gaiwan. The fragrance holds the nutty notes, with some honey and sweet notes.\n\nBeing the first time I am writing about (during) a tea session, I wonder how other people do this. There must be an equilibrium between sitting down, concentrating on the tea and taking notes, and on the other hand, just enjoying the tea.\n\nThe weather is beautiful outside today, and the bowl still needs to cool down. Perhaps I should enjoy on the outside.\n\nThe tea was sweet and smooth and reminded me of stone fruits a bit as well. There were some hints of astringency, a pleasant one, making you want another sip of the liquor. It was perhaps the quickest cup until now, refreshing, smooth, with some sweetness to tie it up, and an enjoyable experience overall. I look forward to the next session.\n\nI will keep the other brews to myself to enjoy this sunny weekend morning, but now that I am transferring these notes, I can tell you it was a very patient tea.","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/Tea/teb":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

In the case of high grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] is not uncommon to use as low a 40-50ºC with 1-2 minutes infusion with a very short ratio of tea:water to extract as much umami and sweetness out of it as possible. \n\nBrews of [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] can traditionally be brewed with boiling water directly in a water kettle for several minutes, resulting in a very intense brew.\n\n\n---\n# References\n[[日本茶のすべてが分かる本]]\n\n\n---\nTags:\nType: #idea\nZettelkasten UID: 202209181802\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"Callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n- 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n- Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts#Types).\n\n## Showcase\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE] Examples\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: example\n\n\u003e [!note] Notes\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: note\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Summaries \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hint \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n\u003e [!success] Success \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n\u003e [!question] Question \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n\u003e [!failure] Failure \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n\u003e [!danger] Error\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n\u003e [!bug] Bug\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: bug\n\n\u003e [!quote] Quote\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.370354089Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question.

Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.374354132Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.374354132Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n\u003e ✏️ Step 2: [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T16:11:42.374354132Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
