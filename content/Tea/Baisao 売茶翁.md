# Baisao
Was a monk living in the Edo period (1603 - 1868) between the 1675 and 1763 when he passed away un the city of Kyoto. He is regarded as the responsible for popularising [[Sencha ç…ŽèŒ¶]] or loose-leaf tea brewing in Japan. At that time China already consumed loose-leaf tea but in Japan power form was still the common way to consume it.
