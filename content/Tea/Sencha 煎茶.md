煎茶 is the most common tea produce in Japan. It is generally an unshaded tea, but it can be shaded as well, known as [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]. The term 露地煎茶 (roadside Sencha) and 純煎茶(じゅん煎茶) (pure Sencha) is also used for unshaded sencha, helping with the division between shaded and unshaded sencha. For both, harvesting is usually machine harvested. Harvest season is usually spring and Summer.

It was in its origins processed via [[Pan-fired teas]] techniques. This can still be seen in the name 煎ったお茶. The name sencha itself can be translated as roasted tea as well. In the actuality, sencha is processed via the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] techniques almost exclusively. If there is a variation, it is usually categorised under a different name.

The shading is applied to reduce the light exposition of the leafs, which in turn reduces the Catechin content and improving the sweetness in the cup. The direct shading of the tea bushes is said to give a 被せ香 a sweet humid resemblance to the earth/soil.

A brewed sencha cup should be, 金色透明 (きんしょくとうめい), golden colour and clear. But as a Japanese green tea bright green colours are also sought after, that is another one of the reasons sometimes it gets shaded. To achieve the deep bright green colours like the ones in [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or [[Shaded teas 覆下栽培]]
