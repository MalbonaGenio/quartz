# Aromatic compounds
There are more than 300 volatile compounds found in tea. Most of the compound's effects, characteristics, and interaction with one another are not known. Some of the more well known are the ones responsible for the characteristically smells of tea. 

In the case of green tea, a grassy aroma known as 青葉アルコール (あおば) or leaf alcohol, is the responsible for the cut grass, green smell. This is also present together with other compounds in the characteristic aroma of fresh cut tea and [[Shincha 新茶]]. This grassy smell is usually reduced or thoroughly removed once the steaming is applied to the leafs. [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]], usually do not present this grassy smell negatively, usually transformed into a more sweet version. 

Other compounds like Pirazin appears once a roasted element or process is applied. like in [[Sencha 煎茶]] or [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]]. The balance between the leaf alcohol grassy aroma and the one from the roasted  from pirazin is very important. It helps determine some qualities of the tea and the intensity of the "branding" if present and in what degree. The pirazin compound is very present in teas like [[Bancha 番茶]]and [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] as the roasting process is more intense.

On high grade Sencha and [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] there is prevalence of another compound, linked to the smell of Nori, a kind of sea weed. The compound is Dimethyl Sulphide and gives the tea the characteristic seaweed smell.

The are many other compounds that provide specific aromas and/or flavours. Some of the most prominent or interesting ones are:

## Differences in aromas depending on the processing
Independently of the process the leaves go trough to become a final product, the initial leaf material is the same, be it different grades of Green tea, [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] or [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]].

The characteristics in everyone of the different processes imbues the final product with series of compounds characteristics of them. In Green teas we have seen that leaf alcohol and pirazin or Dimethyl sulphide balance define a big part of the tea. This is also amplified due to the short time the leaf is left unprocessed or withered, which in the case of Japan tends to be almost 0 change to wither. This helps preserve the original state of the leaf and it "green, fresh" characteristics. After that depending on what processing is applied, [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] or [[Pan-fired teas]]. The compounds composition is altered in very different ways.

For [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]], also know as semi-oxidised (or semi-feremted in some literature) teas, or [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]], known as fully-oxidised. Withering is a key component of the process thus affecting in a great extend the aroma profile and composition of the tea. Black tea can usually present rose or other fruit related smells, Oolongs can present from flower and fruits to other more complex combinations. This is in part dependant on the oolong quality but also the amount of oxidation applied.
