# Zairai 在来種
around 1% of used genetic plant material. 
Natural mix of plants, unpredictable shooting, resistance to cold and insects.

The few zairai fields in Japan are mostly plants from before the use of cultivars became popular. So maybe around 80-90 years old. The tea can be more gentle due to the plant not backing up so many nutrients as young ones.
