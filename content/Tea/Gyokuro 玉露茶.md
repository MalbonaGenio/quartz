玉露茶 translated as "Jade Dew" is one of the [[Shaded teas 覆下栽培]], together with [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]], and the Shaded version of [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]. Is one of the higher grade teas made with the young buds and leaves harvested in Spring only usually.

玉露 leaves are usually covered on a canopy structure on top of the bushes, no directly blanketed like [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]. The shading is also more prolonged at around 20 days. The shading provides the tea with a strong sweetness and umami as the Catechin content is limited due to the limited sun exposure. The shading also provides the tea with the "shading-aura" or aroma 覆い香. See [[Japanese tea shading techniques]].

It can be harvested by machine but also hand picking for the highest quality grades as well as competition grade teas. The processing way is usually the same as for [[Sencha 煎茶]] following the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] manufacturing process.



### Brewing
ice brew, 3g with ~50g of ice for around 1-2 hours until the ice melts completely.
