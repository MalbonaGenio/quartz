The growing regions concentrate in the half south part of Japan.

Shizuoka and Kagoshima having the 36% and 34% of production as of 2019 and in third place Mie with a 7%.  In the case of Shizuoka was not the most producing region at the beginning, it was Mie, but eventually they started taking advantage of their land and the production was considerably higher in a short time. Kagoshima seems to be about to steal the first place, if it hasn't already. The production on Kagoshima really took off after World War 2 when they realized that the conditions were very good, and it has catch up to levels similar to Shizuoka recently and in a very short amount of time.

All the remaining areas do not add to even a 25% of the total production. This includes Miyazaki, Kyoto, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Saga, Saitama, Aichi.
