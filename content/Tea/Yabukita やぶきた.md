# Yabukita やぶきた
Was the first cultivar to be bred in [[Shizuoka 静岡]] in 1908, although it was not registered after some time later in 1953. It presents quite good resistances and good flavour in cup. It is the most cultivated tea cultivar by far, at around 72% as of 2020. Furthermore, it is also the cultivar against all others are compared to.

Balanced taste, good yield, resistance to frost. Used mainly for [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Fukamushi 深蒸し]], [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] and many others.
