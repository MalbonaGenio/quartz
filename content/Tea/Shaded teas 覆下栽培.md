覆下栽培 

Is the method of growing tea under shades to improve the flavour of the leafs using the [[Japanese tea shading techniques]]. It makes up to around an 8% (2020) of the total tea production.

This kind of cultivation technique under shade boosts the production of amino acids in the leafs, in specific the[[L-Theanine]] as well as Chlorophyll 葉緑素. As a result of that the amount of Catechin is lower in shaded teas as the plant does not need them for protecting against the sunlight as it would in a non-shaded tea.

The shading is applied to reduce the light exposition of the leafs which in turn reduces the Catechin content and improving the sweetness in the cup. The direct shading of the tea bushes is said to give a 被せ香 a sweet humid resemblance to the earth/soil.

The most common shaded teas are:
- [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]]
- [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]]
- [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]]
- [[Hakuyoucha 白葉茶]]
