# History of the Japanese Tea
Following is what we know from Tea in Japan, how it arrived, was grown and drink, and eventually diverged from the Chinese Tea Culture onto it own.

## Chronology of Tea in Japan


## Ancient times (China)

~BC 2800, Shennong 神農, the divine farmer legend of cataloging wild plants and herbs. The encounter within humans and tea.

~BC 59　Han Dinasty, Oldest writen tea reference in the "Slaves contract", a contract set out by Wang Bao 王褒 when buying the slave Bianliao from Lady Yang Hui. It descrives buying tea, boiling water and preparing the utenils as tasks to be performed by Bian Liao. It also shows how the tea was starting to be enjoied by the upper class in Chinese society at that time.

~AD 760 Tang Dinasty 618-907 [[The Classic of Tea 茶経]]is published by Lu Yu 陸羽

## 弥生時代　BC300 - AD300
239 Himiko 卑弥呼 the shaman queen reings, Japan is mentioned in "records of the Three Kindgoms"

## Asuka period 飛鳥時代　550~710
~538 Emperor Kimmei 欽明天皇 reigns, good relationships with the kingdom of Baekje (Korea) reigned by  King Song Myong (聖明王,Seimeiou in Japanese). Buddism is introduced to Japan.

### 9th century 
Tea was introduced into Japan by Buddhist monks travelling to China. On their way back they brought tea with them as they grow used to drink it while in China an during meditation sessions. The two monks we have knowledge of are, Saicho that introduced around Kyoto. And Kukai, that did into Wakayama.

This first introduction was tea most probably in powder form that they brought. It was introduced into the temples but nothing more happened for a few hundred years.

### 12th Century
1190's with monk Eisai was the real "start" of Tea in Japan. Some might say that the tree was already there and was not first introduced from the outside. But there is no way to know. Others argue that the tea was there already but people did not know about it's properties until later on. 

## Miyoe monk

[[Eisai]] brought not only tea but also seeds, those where planted in an Island in the region of 長崎 Nagasaki, 佐賀 Saga located in 九州 Kyushu island and in 京都 Kyoto as well.

Eisai not only did that but also wrote the [[Kissa Yojoki]] a book about the benefits of drinks for health, and Eisai recommend tea, as well as Mulberry infusion.

1269 Chabustusan, a book about tea-ware published in China but with illustrations depicting the mills for grounding tea, one similar to the traditional one for Matcha as wells a more common one for medicinal herbs or spices. There is as well others like a whisk. 800 years ago tea in powder form [[Matcha 抹茶]] was already there, produced and consumed but, the shading techniques where not yet invented.

So we can see that the tea was ground, added with water int a bowl and whisked just like matcha today but without the shading. 茶色 gives a hint on the original type of tea at that time as it means brown colour. So probably the colour of the powder tea consumed at that time was brown and very different from the [[Matcha 抹茶]] we are used now.

### 13th Century
Tea as medicine is the main topic and use.

### 14th - 15th Century
茶香服 Chakabuki, a game consisting on tasting blindly several bowls, 9 or 11 of teas and guess which one is the "real tea", the one grown in Kyoto. The tea was something similar to [[Matcha 抹茶]] and there used to be gambling involved eventually. The gambling was eventually prohibited although never very much enforced.

### 15th -16th Century
1580's some parts of the society, specially in the temples saw the getting out of the temples into the palaces and lavish tea parties. This part of society tried to bring it back to the ceremonial root s of the origins. The most well know actor in this movement was Sen no Rikyu. He was not the first one to start the movement but he codified and written the practice that eventually derived into the main 3 schools of tea ceremony and the others as well.

1650's is the start of the loose-leaf tea in japan, thanks to Ingen monk. Ingen was a monk from china coming to Japan to build a temple in Kyoto, in Uji, the Manpukuji. In China originally they drink powder tea, until that time Japan used to consume it in the same powder form. Ingen became the first one to bring the new way that was already in China into Japan. Farmers then started to develop news techniques more suited for this new method of brewing. This tea was probably something similar to [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]] as the [[Pan-fired teas]] was the method used in China and Japan still hadn't developed the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] production methods.

Somewhere around the 15 and 16th Century shading is used to protect the crops from the cold weather and frost. By the 18th Century it was widely used in [[Matcha 抹茶]] and later in [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] production as well. A change in flavour on the places were this shading was used was the primer for shading the tea, making the final product more sweet and pleasant.

Around 1735 [[Baisao 売茶翁]] is serving tea in leaf form, as he learned in the monastery he was a monk in, as a tea peddler around the city of Kyoto. By 1738 his brewing style was more common and popular and the years leading to that fruited in to the experimentation by the tea farmers to create the loose leaf tea version of Japan.

In 1738 Nagatani Souen in Uji, invented a new production method that is the base for modern tea production in Japan, at that time [[Sencha 煎茶]]. And eventually all the other teas as well. The method included the use of [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] done by hand in a paper covered table. 

In 1835 came the invention of [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], mainly by change. At that time [[Matcha 抹茶]] powder was still the main tea, and [[Japanese tea shading techniques]] were used. The producers where prompted to try create a loose-leaf tea out of the shaded leafs as well and thus creating the [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]]. That was then moved to the capital Tokyo and it became a hit.

1884 Japan was "forced" to open borders and tea was already expanded and consumed around the world in many countries. Japan decided to export it's tea production as well. For this they created the [[Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association 公益社団法人日本茶業中央会]] was created, to boost exports and still exists today.

1885 Kenzo Takabayashi, a medical doctor, observing that the tea production was still 100% done by hand, created the Sencha processing machine. The principles on how it works still apply in most part in modern machines. This machine helped produce more quantity. Also provide a way to compete better in the export trends after the borders i Japan opened after 1884.

1904 [[Yabukita やぶきた]] Cultivar is registered. By Hikosaburo Sugiyama which would become and still is the most used cultivar in Japan.

1915 Tea shears are adopted as a [[Harvesting methods 収穫方法]] to improve harvest quantities.

1955 The first tea harvesting machine is introduced, singe person handled. Later on a battery would be added in 1962

1965 Two person harvesting machine. Can harvest up to 300-400kg per day with only 2-3 persons.

1971 Driven harvesting machines are introduced for more industrialised gardens in flat areas. Allows around 1 ton or more to be harvested per day.

1984 Worlds first canned green tea is introduced and later one substituted by the plastic bottle green tea in 1990. Both of them by Ito En, the biggest tea brand in the world.

1999 The Japanese tea instructor program is born. The idea being that if you train people in tea they will come back to the tea pots as an exploration.

2015 Japanese Tea Export promotion council. Exports were going and the government wanted to support and grow the exports.

2019 GJTA is born.
