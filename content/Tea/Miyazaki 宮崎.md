# Miyazaki 宮崎
includes regions like:
- Takachiho
- Gokase
- Kawaminami
- Miyakonojo
- Kushima
Although it is neibourh with [[Kagoshima 鹿児島]] the spread of the farms is quite diferent. Because a lot of the cultivated area in the region is on the mountanous areas, with some pretty high mountians at 1600-1700 meters and farms around the 600-700 m mark. The biggest producing area is the Miyakonojo.

This elevation does not mean step hills, as the whole terrain elevates quite uniformly in some areas, leaving some cultivation possible at high altitute. 

Miyazaki started in the 17th century. It had strong clan power in the Kyushu area and also a lot of influence during the Meiji era. In tea, there are known connections with Kyoto region and the methods used by [[Nagatani Souen]] of [[Sencha 煎茶]] and needle shaped tea manufacturing. 

This metods were adopted quite early on in the region.

Some unique features are that they still use burning agriculture, very much practiced in the region. Especially when renewing the fields for example or pruning.

Tea cultivations is mainly in the proximity to mountains or in pathced in the mountains. This brigns the production of Miyazaki to a very low volume compared to the other three major producion areas of [[Shizuoka 静岡]], [[Kagoshima 鹿児島]] and [[Mie 三重]].

More handheld machines are used due to the terrain as well.

Tea kinds of the region are [[Sencha 煎茶]] and a regional specialty of Kyushu [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]] using the Chinese method of pan-firing to stop oxidation [[Pan-fired teas 釜炒り茶]] [[Pan-fired teas]].
