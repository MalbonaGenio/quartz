釜炒り茶 (Kamairicha) is composed of Kama (釜), (iron pot, pan, cauldron) and 炒り (fry, roast, parch). Also, can be seen labelled as Kamaguri 釜ぐり.

釜炒り茶 is then a pan fired tea, in contrast with the usual process of steamed teas that make up the bulk of the production in Japan commonly. It's a process believed to originate In China, where it is still being used, and can also be seen in some Korean teas as well. It was introduced trough Kyushu, and it has remained as a regional speciality. Once it was the original main method of processing tea before the invention of the steaming method in Kyoto, that spread farther out and became prevalent quickly. The steamed version of [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] tried to simulate the Kamairicha process at the beginning and thus both versions remain possible to be found.

In contrast to the more common types of green teas in Japan, leaves manufactured as Kamairicha are not rolled in needle shape, but left to be curled and twisted. Giving the appearance of a lesser tea, but that is not the case at all. The production is found mainly in Kyushu where this kind of processing of the leaves is thought that was introduced first, from mainland China. 

It remained in the island without expaning too much, in the actual times [[Miyazaki 宮崎]] produces 38% of the total production The neighboriung regions add up to a total of 99% production voulme for this tea in Japan. [[Saga]] at 34%, [[Oita]] at 18%, [[Kumamoto]] at 7% and [[Nagasaki]] at 2%.

There are two distinct styles, the Ureshino Style 嬉野製, common in Saga and Nagasaki. And the Aoyagi Style 青柳製, common in Kumamoto and Miyazaki. The Ureshino Style presents a 45º inclination of the firing pan, while the Aoyagi is kept parallel to the floor.

Factory machines can be used, using a mechanical pan to stop the oxidation (known as kill-green). Then rolling of the leafs in a circular motion machine that presses the leaves together and helps break the cellular structure of the tea. As a final step there is another round of firing in a pan to develop the "KamaKa" (釜香), the smell of the pan, a roast aroma characteristic of the Kamairicha processed teas.

### Flavour profile and brewing indications
釜炒り茶 teas are round and mellow, and can handle a bit higher temperatures than [[Sencha 煎茶]] or [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] teas. 3gr per 100ml at 85º for 40 sec is a good start.
