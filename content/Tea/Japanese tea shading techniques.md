# Japanese tea shading techniques 被覆方法
Sweetness is one of the main desired flavours together with [[Umami]]. This preference, together with a desire to reduce the bitterness of the the brew, developed in cultivation techniques that boost the sweetness and lowers the bitterness. Mimicking the natural shade that the tea bushes might get when grow in forested areas, shading techniques were developed to shade the bushes were natural shading was not possible, like in the modern flat tea plantations of today.

The main cause that creates a different flavour profile is that the limited sun exposure for the photosynthesis of the leafs prevents the amino acids like [[L-Theanine]] to turn into [[Catechin]]. This is a desirable trait in high grade teas like [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] to form a sweeter more umami cup. The tea leaves harvested via this shading technique tend to be softer, thinner and tends to stretch for sunlight. Typical cover is 85~90% but depends on the type of tea, region and time that is going to be shaded.

The shading techniques have evolved from the old origins into a cheaper and less labor intensive for the farmer. Also, they have been adopted for teas that traditionally grow unshaded, to boost the umami flavour in the cup. Examples of this are shaded [[Sencha 煎茶]], known as 被せ茶・被せん茶.

## Shading methods
There are to diferent shading methods depending on how they are applied or build into the field. 棚がけ (shelf-style) or 直がけ (direct application style)

### Straw cover honzuhifuku 
Is perhaps the most similar to the old shading methods, and it’s mainly used for [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] and [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] production. It is a shading that is applied like a canopy on top of a wooden, stone or metal structure using mainly two different kinds of materials. A bamboo screen 葦簀 is laid first to create a shading for the initial 7-10 days over the teas, blocking 50-60% of the sunlight. After that rice straw 稲藁 is spread on top of the bamboo screen blocking up to 98% of the sunlight for the remaining time of the shading process until the leaf material is harvested. 

Some farmers prefer this method as the natural material can also create a pleasant aura in the shaded tea leafs and help absorb humidity present during the shading state. (See Kuma farmer from Yame interview from the Japanese tea marathon.) It is overall a more labor intensive process and the rice straw needs to be purchased and spread by hand, same for the bamboo screen although that can be reused. The rice straws can also be later used as a natural fertiliser for the bushes.

In some high grade teas that use this shading technique together with other traditional techniques for the harvesting and processing can be found labeled as 本玉露.

### Cheesecloth cover 寒冷紗
The newer, more economical and less labor intensive shading technique derived from the [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]]. Uses a synthetic material as a cover instead of bamboo or rice. The main differences would be the more cheap and reusable material. Easy installation and ease of use, remove or layer on top of another shade to regulate the amount of sunlight. Some of the structures used with this covers can be permanent metal bars were the covers can be put on or off with ease. Similar to a greenhouse this ease of use can also be used to regulate temperature as a protection or for other applications as well.

#### Double layer cover 棚型二段被覆
This method is very similar to the [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]], a first layer is spread on a shelf structure regulation the sunlight for the first half of the shading process. Then at around 7-10 days another layer of the synthetic cover is laid on top of the first one. The final shading amount is virtually the same, up to 98% and the only real diferences is the ease of instalation fro the farmer. 

This method does not provide a natural added fertilizer like the rice straw once removed, and altough the shading happens the straw and bamboo efect is not transmitted into the leafs. High grade competition tea are usually shaded with the more [[#Straw cover honzuhifuku]] method and the rest of high grade for main consumption are shaded using this Double layer method.

#### Tunnel cover トンネル被覆
It is a technique similar to the shelf-like strucure for the [[#Double layer cover]], in this case though the shading is laid on top of removable metal arcs. This allows to shade the sides of the tea bush as well with the same cover. It is a method common for Kabusecha. This method is not as comon as [[#Direct blanketing]]. Due to the added work of building the arc structure before covering the bushes. It provides a more easier environment for the leaves to grow and fro the air and humidity to move around the structure unlike the [[#Direct blanketing]]. 

#### Direct blanketing 直接被覆
The shades are applied directly on top of the bushes, covering the sides as well. This is probably the most easy way to install and remove the shades. It is part of the iconic Japanese tea field image of aligned bushes rows. This metjod is usually applied for [[Sencha 煎茶]] and Kabusecha as does not allow to the humidity and air to move as easy as other methods. It can also be found in lower grades of [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] . Blanketing directly also means that the material is in direct contact with the newly grown leafs, creating a friction for the growth as the shoot upwards. if the shade is tensed on the bushes it could be counterproductive for their grow.
