# Fukamushi 深蒸し

Deep steamed [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] variant of [[Sencha 煎茶]], for young or coarser leafs as well. Sun grown with harvests in spring and summer.

Steaming is between 1 and 2 minutes, although there is no set standard of what time is light medium or deep steaming.

Started in [[Shizuoka 静岡]] as a way to make coarser sun grown leafs from scale production easier to process and at the same time improve colour and flavour release of the final tea. It's how most of the Sencha is most commonly processed. Presents a stronger deeper flavour, favoured in Big cities like Tokyo because of its vibrant colour.

Also, can be found with light shading, but less than [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] at around 7-10 days.
