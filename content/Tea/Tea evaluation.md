# Tea evaluation
There are two main types:
- Auction: Usually thematic by day(Sencha, Tencha, Gyokuro...)
- Competition: Like in hand rolled competitions f.example.

## Appearance
- Shape: Twisted and curly, well stretched...
- Colour of the leaf: Deep colour, glossy, bright...
## Aroma

## Colour of the brew

## Taste

## Defects
Defect flavours include a wide range of things, not necessarily negative flavour connotations. 

Large leaf, unequal lengths of leafs, burnt, light, sediment, Gyokuro-like flavours in a Sencha cup...

For a total of 200 points:
