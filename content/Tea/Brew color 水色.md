The brew of the tea is one of the key factors in determining the quality of the tea itself. There are two main components that give the brew their appearance. 

In the case of [[Sencha 煎茶]] the flavonoids are the main component that results in a yellow brew. This yellow can be more of muted tones almost brownish due to oxidation in lower grade teas. See [[Green colour preservation]]. Or mor bright color in higher grades. The green suspended particles or tint color present in the brew comes from the chlorophyll itself.

In deep steam tea the color is more of a bright green and usually with more suspended powder in the brew as well. Looking more like  turbulent tea, this is not a bad indicator for deep steamed teas as the leaf becomes very soft and easely crumbles durign the processign stage. See [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]].

A red tint or stain might be present in some brews, this is caused due to the catechins present in the drink. This is usually present due to the degradation of the chlorophyll via heat, light or oxygen exposure. This is considered a sign of a lower grade tea as the [[Processing method 製茶方法]] or the [[Green colour preservation]] has not been expertly achieved. 

This is not a bad trait in [[Bancha 番茶]] or [[Pan-fired teas]] like  [[Kamairicha  釜炒り茶]] where the application of heat durning either the Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい) or the Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい) makes the catechins to oxidise to some degree. It is a similar case for [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] where the application of heat for the roasting also producess a similar effect among the roast development.

A brigth red colour is a characeristic trait of [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] as this are fully oxidised. In [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] the brew will look more yellow if it's lightly oxidised or more redish is more oxidised. Also the roastign or not of the oolong will also affect the end brew color.
