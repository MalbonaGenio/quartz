Commodity is bulk tea actively traded and the price is determined by the markets. The price is usually in currency/Kg.

Most of the famous tea beverages in cultures around the world (English Breakfast, Moroccan Mint, etc) are based in bulk commodity tea as they are very extended in their consumption.

There is however a large amount of high quality tea called specialty tea. Teas that have greater quality characteristics. These teas can also be found in blends for the drinks like English Breakfast, but prices and also qualities are completely different then. 

## Quality factors
### Leaf format
Leaf format might be one of the biggest factor and it's very linked with the processing methods used. Generally, the smaller the leaf the lower the quality, higher teas being made up of full leaves or more than one, buds too.
### Infusion 
Tea is water used to extract the soluble solids in the tea leaf.  Resulting in a 2% of compounds from the leaves in the water. The soluble solids can be generalised depending on the type of tea used. As well as surface area of the tea, chemical properties of the water, atmospheric pressure, water temperature and infusion time. 

See [[Steeping]] and [[Soluble solids in Tea leaves]]

### Type of tea
It is the key component as it determines what soluble solids are in the leaves. The types of tea are defined by the [[Tea processing type]]. Same process will give a similar components in the leaves. All tea types share major chemical components: polyphenols, amino acids, enzymes, pigments, carbohydrates, alkaloids, minerals, volatile compounds. And those affect the taste, color, body and smell of the cup. 

How much of the components end up in the cup depends in the surface area of the tea leaf, the properties of the water, atmospheric pressure, water temperature and infusion time

### Surface area 
The more area exposed the more the rate of dissolution is increased. The same mass of different tea have big variations of surface area exposed. Adding full leaf tea with low surface area also increases the rate of dissolution.

## [[Chemical properties of water]]
The ability of water to extract the solid compounds from the leaf is aided or impeded by: pH levels, hardness levels and mineral levels.

pH should be between 6.5 to 8.5, standard levels for drinking water. Lower pH will be more acidic and lighter infusion and higher pH more alkaline darker infusion.

Water hardness is Magnesium and Calcium dissolved in the water. Being temporary or permanent, referring to Magnesium/Calcium Bicarbonates or Carbonates respectively. Temporary hardness can dull the color of the tea and promote the creation of scum. 

Polyphenols bind to this minerals during the extraction of the flavours. To high levels of minerals will result in a metallic taste while too low in an empty, dull flavour. TDS meters are a way to know the levels of minerals but not the composition of them.

## Atmospheric pressure
At sea level (+- 14,7 psi) boiling point is 100ÂºC. Higher altitudes, pressure is lower and boils under 100ÂºC. You can use vacum to infuse tea at temperatures well below 100ÂºC.

## Water temperature.
