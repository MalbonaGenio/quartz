# Shizuoka ÈùôÂ≤°
includes regions like:
- Fuji
- Honyama
- Shimizu
- Kawane
- Tenryu
- Kakegawa
- Makinohara
- Ashikubo

On the sea line the land is flatter and the land is developed into large scale production. There is of course mountain slopes and regions with a higher altitude where the tea is also produced in a more small scale but Shizuoka really is a high volume production regions. In here they have available a tea market for auctions and also factories of tea making equipment like 

The shizuoka soil has an interesting mix as 4 tectonic plates come together in this regions. This showcase very differetn soil mixtures depending on the area the farm is located. This is a great point for this high volume region as it can showcse a variety of flavour profiles even though its volume production is very high and that is often seen as an obstacle for flavour profile diversity.

Shizuoka tea started in the 13th  century, just around 100 years after the introduction into Kyoto area by buddist monks. Ashikubo is regarded as the beggingn of the cultivation in shizuoka by the hand of the buddist monk Eni. At the beginning it was mainly on the mountain sites and it develped into the flatlands later on.

From the Meiji restoration is when the production changed the most in the area, after the end of the isolation period. Lots of samurai class families became farmers and some became tea farmers, like the ones in Makinohara. Eventually Shizuoka would became the largest area for tea in this timeframe. 

The history is quite far but the most expanded of production was around 150 years ago.

Shizuoka is know as an industrial place and also has be the birthplace of important historical developments like the [[Yabukita „ÇÑ„Å∂„Åç„Åü]] cultivar in 1908 and the development of the handheld harvesting machine in 1965 and the later driven versions as well. 

A lot of manufacturing is present in Shizuoka, like Suzuki. As well as tea machinery makers like Kawasaki, Terada and -----.

Shizuoka was the initial region to focus in the growing of Japanese tea cultivars.

There is a tea museum recently renovated with regional and iternational tea, as well as ancient machines for tea manufacturing.

Shizuoka presents a lot of flatlands and it is the main areas where tea is grown at the present time. it is grown at scale with very big factories producing several tons a day.

There is also a small areas on the mountain where tea is also grown like Tenryu and Ashikubo. in very sloppy hills and above clouds altitude on those regions, presenting family operated farms as compared to the cooperatives in the flatlands.

Shizuoka specializes in [[Sencha ÁÖéËå∂]] production and they are well known for the [[Fukamushi Ê∑±Ëí∏„Åó]] tea process, a more deep steam procces of the last 100 years. This was developed du to the growing conditions in the flatlands with a higher exposure to sunligth, the leafs grow coarser and thus the deep steam helps in the processing as well in the final flavor release and quality as well. It has become the major way to process tea there. 

This kind of steaming makes the tea look much more vivid green and a nice flavour as well, so it has become very well regarded, specially in major urban areas.
