# Storage of tea

When storing tea the most important things to consider are:
- Air
- Temperature
- Light
- Moisture
- Smells

The affect [[L-Theanine]], [[Caffeine]], [[Catechin]], Vitamins and Chlorophyll. Theanine and caffeine can be stable with normal storage and the rest are more sensitive to storage conditions. Some to oxygen presence like [[Catechin]] and some to light like chlorophyll.

## Storage options
Packaging materials can have zip enclosures, aluminium foiled walls, one way valves etc. Depending on the original packaging material it is recommended to switch the tea to other storage options like caddies instead of just a paper bag for example. Or vacuum storage options were you can apply vacuum like some glass container offer.

Other options for storage include wine bottle cellars, freezers, pumidors etc. Fridge can be a good option for daily tea or a tea that is being consumed actively. The teas that are in long term storage, not actively consumed, very high grade teas or teas that are being consumed but not the whole quantity. Higher grade teas are more sensitive to storage conditions and they will require to be handled more carefully.

With teas stored into freezers care with condensation is an issue to consider. If closed well condensation should only happen on the outside of the bag. We can be very quick in taking out the amount we need and immediately put it back in the freezer so condensation does not happen. Or take out the tea package and let it stabilise before opening it.

## Shelf life
With proper storage conditions, no air, low temperature, dry and dark environment at least a year.

Professional farms have "super" freezers at around -35CÂº and they can hold the tea for more as the degradation happens very slowly.
