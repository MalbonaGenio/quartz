After harvesting the leaf material it is transported into the factories, were it undergoes it's transformation into a product that can be brewed later.

This process is separated in two main events. The production of the tea itself and the refining of the final product. The first is the transformation of the harvested leaf into "unrefined tea" or 荒茶 (あらちゃ), later on the tea is sorted, blended, branded, etc to create the final "refined tea" or 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃ).

This two processes can be done traditionally by hand 手揉み製茶 or by machine 機械揉み製茶. Nowadays 99% of the tea is produced by machines, as the Traditional method is very labor intensive and produce very few tea. It is still practiced by conservation societies or groups and there are yearly competitions that showcase the hand process style.

## Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい)
This process takes care to stop the oxidation process, then roll and dry the leafs. The main characteristics that are modified during this process are the taste, aroma and apparence of the tea.

The first step on the process is to stop the oxidation process that the leaf experiences after being harvested. This process is called 殺精 (さっせい) or "kill-green" and is done by heating the leaves above 70 degress, this deactivates the enzimes responsible for the oxidation process. It is a key part in preserving the golden or green colour of the tea, wich will turn reddish to brown as the oxidation preocess continues, ending up in a partially oxidised tea like [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] or [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]]. 

This heating stage can be achieved in two ways, the most common way is using steam, 烝熱 (じょうねつ), which will then follow the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] processing techniques. This include the main bulk of the Japanese green teas, [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]], [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] and the steamed variant of the [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]]. The degree of steaming is regarded as light 淺蒸し, medium 普通蒸し, or deep 深蒸し , although there is no clear definition in what is each one of this categories, it is very dependant on the regions, culture, farmer etc. As a rule of thumb below 1 minute of steaming can be considered by many light 淺蒸し steaming. Above that 1 minute deep 深蒸し steaming. Medium steaming is a category used sometimes, but most time we talk of light or deep steaming.

Another way is by applying heat directly trough a heated pan/wok, it is a rare method in Japan but the default method in other countries like China or Korea, from where it is believed it arrived to Japan and became the first tea processing methods. Teas that are treated using this method follow the [[Pan-fired teas]] processing techniques. The teas produced by this method is the pan-fired variant of the [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]].

After the 殺精 (さっせい), there is a series of rolling stages and a final drying, which crush the molecular structure of the leaf, help bring the humidity to the surface to dry and give the final needle shape. Check [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] for in-depth explanation of each rolling stage. In the case of [[Pan-fired teas]], or mainly the pan-fired version of [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] there is some rolling applied but no straightening of the leafs, thus maintaining the curled shape.

After all this processes around 80% of the weight is lost due to the evaporation of the water in the leaf.

## Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい)
Altough Aracha tea is ready to be drinked, a Shiage or refining process takes care of refining the leaves, separating them by size or colour, blending to achieve a even profile, or "branding" the tea. Sometimes this process can be skipped, only apply some of the methods or only one of them. Most of the times this process is also done by wholesalers that buy from farmers and to their own refining to have their own blends with the particular characteristics that they are looking for their products.

This four processes can also be done enitrely by hand following traditional methods.

### Sorting 選別 (せんべつ)
This is perhaps the easiest process to explain and apply. The aracha tea is graded to separate  leaves into different sizes, shapes or colour. The different grades are usually:
- Final tea leaves 本茶 (ほんちゃ), it is the highest grade.
- Stems 茎 (くき), stems from the leaves, used in [[Kukicha 茎茶]] and it's variants.
- Heavy particles, 芽茶 (めちゃ) or めこ, made of broken coarse leaves.
- Lighter particles, ほそこ　粉, made of fine more powdery particles.

棒茶　粉茶

The sorting can be done by sieves, air or static electricity and color as well. This methods can be used in combination, in particular with color separation.

Sieves can spearate the leaves by vibration, wich usually spearates leaves by thickness or be rotating horizontally, which separate by length.

Air separates by weigth as depending on the mass it will travel longer or shorter disctance. Ususally is used after sieveing, to separate leaves from stems or the diferent types of coarse leafs or broken leaves and powder.

Static electricity charges the leaves and this are send in diferent directions.

Color sorter are able to find diferences in color on leaves of the same size and weight that might have gotten trough the other methods. I can be great to clean up the apparence of the final product and it provides a high fidelity separation ability



### Cutting 切断 (せつだん)
Sorted leaves can be of the same thicknes when sorted out but still have diferent lengths. The leaves are just inserted into a machine that cuts the leaves to a predefined lengngth. This can also be applied to leaves that are bigger than the starndard 本茶 leaves to cut them into smaller pieces.

### Firing 火入 (ひいれ)
It is the final process, that modifies the leafs itself. Heat is applied using, hot air, direct heat, infrared rays or even microwaves around 80Cº to 110Cº. This will give the aroma characteristic of firing without going as long as roasting tea leaves like in a [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] where it is usually over 130Cº. This process is also called branding and it is a step where the producer can "brand" their teas by using this heat and bring out a different more roasty, nutty aroma. This aroma is called 火香 (ひか).



### Blending 合組 (ごうぐみ)
This process can be just blending again the different tea leaves sorted out during the Shiage process or blend only some part of it. It can also be blending different leaves from different farms, same farms but different varietals or the same ones as well. It all comes down to the product that one wants to create or maintain stable for the customers year after year. This creates balanced flavours that maybe some single tea could not achieve for example. Also works to combine the different products of the same farm to not waste any product and still offer an aprochable and inexpensive product for the consumer.


## Production amounts per type
In 2019 the volume of tea produced in % was:
- [[Sencha 煎茶]] ~54%
- [[Bancha 番茶]] ~32%
- [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] (shaded teas) ~4%
- [[Tamaryokucha 玉緑茶]] 3%
- Others 3%
