# Japan Tea Distribution
The three main actors are the growers, processors and the distributors. Although not every region has the same structures we can identify three main routes of distribution. Distribution of raw leaf, distribution of [[Processing method 製茶方法#Aracha process 荒茶工程 (あらちゃこうてい)| crude tea Aracha]] and distribution of [[Processing method 製茶方法#Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい)|refined tea Shiagecha]].

The raw leaf is processed into Aracha from the growers or cooperatives by the a producer organizatiopn, although there are many cases where this individual producers or cooperatives have their own facilites as well. 

The crude tea is  then gathered trough the tea market or trough cooperatives and refined, blended etc.　Some regions like Shizuoka and Kyoto have a ong tradition as producing areas. On top of that they hold large distribution centers where they gather not only crude tea or refined tea from that region but from other famous producing regions as well. 

This large distribution centers gathered as well processign facilities for refined tea as well as brokers, packing companies and machine manufacturers.　

Then trough the wholesales is distribute to the small shops, department stores etc. The traceability for the producer, manufacturer is a key aspect so can be maintained until it reaches the final consumer.  

## Information about the components
In order to not loose information about the product there are strict regulations about the information that need to be showed in the packaging.

In 1999 (Heisei 11) the JAS law was modified to include tea as a processed food. This means that tea product labels had to state a list of items in order to be sold. This include:
- Name
- List of ingredients
- net content 
- expiration date
- Conservation methods
- country of origin
- importer name
- manufacturer or seller name
In addition all the raw ingredients countries have to be stated as well.

There is some optional information like:
- Concrete tea species
- Cultivar name
- Land or location of growing name
- Company name
- Packaging type
- Handling precautions
For organic products JAS also regulates labelling:
- Organically grown and organically processed products
- Specially grown agricultural products

Due to some labelling fraud and to improve the reliability of the product another set of labelling standar was created in 2004  (heisei 16) by the [[ Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association 公益社団法人日本茶業中央会]]  to establish a code of conduct for the industry to comply.
This makes the information that need to be on the label very precise, only being able to stipulate that a tea is Kyoto tea if the contents are 100% from Kyoto, for example.
