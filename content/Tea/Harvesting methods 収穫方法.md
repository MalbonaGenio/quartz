Tea can be harvested by hand 手摘み (てづみ) or by machine 機械摘み (きかいづみ).

## Hand harvesting 手摘み
Until the Taisho Era (1912–26) manual hand harvesting was the main method. Currently this method is only used for competition grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] or ceremonial grade [[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]]. It is done manually by plucking 摘菜 (てきさい) an specific amount of leafs depending on the tea that is going to be produced. It can range from 1 bud and 2 leafs 一芯二葉 (いちしんによう) to 1 bud and 5 leaves 一芯五葉 (いっしんごよう). 

Usually the bud and the 2  first leafs are used for [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]],[[Tencha 挽き茶・碾茶]] and other higher grade teas. Anything below that is used in [[Bancha 番茶]] and other lower grade teas, like [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] as well.

There are as well different techniques on how these amounts are harvested from the bush:
- Bending 折り摘み (おりづみ) 
- Pulling しごき摘み
- Plucking かき摘み

This techniques determine as well the amounts of tea leaves that can be harvested in a day, as it is very time and labour consuming. But, it also determines the quality of the selected leaves and the damage that they sustain during the harvest.

### Tea shears 手鋏
Another hand harvesting method was introduced in 1915, with the handheld shears 手鋏 (てばさみ). They are similar to the one used for pruning trees or bushes today. Attached to the shears there is a cloth pouch where the leaves are deposited after cutting. This provided a huge boost to productivity by around 6 to 8 times compared to hand harvesting.

## Machine harvesting 機械摘み
There are two main methods for machine harvesting, handheld machines 可搬式摘採機 (かはんしきてきさいき) or driven machines 乗用摘採機 (じょうようてきさいき).

Handheld machines were introduced in the 1950s and allow 1 or 2 people to harvest very efficiently, sometimes 3 people are used as well. This machines where the natural evolution of the scissors 手挟み (てばさみ) used in harvesting that substituted the hand harvesting methods. 

###  1 person harvesting machine
In the Showa era 昭和30 (1955) the first single person handheld machine was introduced. It was first hand operated to revolve a drum with blades that cut the leafs, similar to a bush trimmer, but manually. Later on in 1962 a battery was added making it more efficient and easy to use. compared to hand picking it was 19 times more efficient and compared to the shears around 1.8 times. 

Due to the weight and the even the battery powered one can be tricky to held and keep in level when cutting over the tea bushes so it has been replaced by the 2 person variant.

### 2 persons harvesting machine
In the Showa era 昭和40 (1965) the first 2 person handheld harvesting machine was developed. It is held by 2 persons one on each side of the tea bush, placing the cutting bladed at the desired height. When walking alongside the tea rows the tea leaf is harvested and stored in a bag that is being carried along. 

Sometimes a third person is in charge of holding the bag as this machine can harvest significantly more quantity than the previous methods. It's productivity can go up 60 times compared to hand picking, allowing up to 300-400 kg of leaves to be harvested with only 2-3 people.

This machines are very common method for harvesting in small garden or gardens situated in hill and mountain environments. Places where the driven versions of this cutter cannot be used. One of the disadvantages is that both operators have to sync very well to maintain the machine levelled and at the harvesting height that is desired. This creates of course some mixed harvesting as some coarser leafs will be harvested as well. Creating the need to sort them out in the [[Processing method 製茶方法#Shiage process 仕上げ茶 (しあげちゃこうてい) |shiage sorting process]] 

### Driven harvesting machines
This can be operated by 1 or 2 persons, as a basic explanation imagine the handheld harvester machine placed on wheels or threads. Then a person on top is in charge of driving the machine along the tea rows at the desired height. This machines are capable of harvesting around 1 ton or more per day. They are very productive and very common in flatlands where the fields stretch for several hectares. They have a high cost so they are commonly used within cooperatives or large tea garden in flatlands.

As with the [[#2 persons harvesting machine]] the irregularities in the terrain, or the height setting of the machine on each segment of the field can end up with a mixed harvest. This will include coarser leaves that will need to be sorted out later. 

Some driving machines can be operated by a single person and unload the leaves into a container or bags that can later load on a van and be transported to the factory.

### Automatic harvesting machines
This machines are somewhat similar to the driven harvesting machines with some key differences. First, they are usually automatic in the sense that do not require a driver. This is because they are set on top of rails installed along the tea bushes. The rails help considerably when it comes to overcome the irregularities of the terrain. 

Secondly, this machines can be very precisely set to a height that will be constant in the whole length of the rails. This helps to achieve harvested material similar to hand [[#Hand harvesting 手摘み]] methods. This machines can be used before harvest as pruning, then the height is logged. When it is time to harvest the field can be levelled to the old measure to know where the new shots are located.

This require more infrastructure than any other method but provides an automatic and good quality harvest material.
