# Farming activities

### Weeding
Weeds can be dangerous for young plants as they can compete for soil nutrient and for sunlight. For more mature plants are more of a nuisance.

### Pesticides
After the fertilization is done bugs are usually attracted, pesticide spray is applied to cover the leafs. This application can be delayed, applied only in certain season or just particular pesticides for regional bugs and pests.

### Trimming
Activity similar to harvesting but a bit depper, usually without harvest of the leafs and leaving the material on the soil to become nutient for the soil.

### Deep trimming
Much lower than trimming, below leaf heigth, usually perfomed every 3 years to renew the growth of the bushes.
