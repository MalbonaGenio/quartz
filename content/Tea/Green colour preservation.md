Chlorophyll is the main reason for the green color in plants. When the leaves are picked and left as it is the oxidation process will shift the color from green to a brownish black color. 

At the time of processing the leaves are either applied steam, [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] or put on a fired pan, [[Pan-fired teas]]. This deactivates the oxidase reduction reaction. In Japanese this process is know as 殺青 (さっせい) or kill-green. This process once completed prevents further oxidation and mantains the characteristic green color for green teas. This process is of course used in the [[Japanese Black Tea 和紅茶]] and [[Japanese Oolong ウーロン茶]] tea production to produce fully oxidise or semi-oxidised teas.

However during the processing heat, light and air exposure can gradually continue the reaction. This causes part of the Chlorophyll to turn into Pheophytin, a breakdown product of Chlorophyll and a key component for the Photosystem in plants. This breakdown turns into a dark indigo almost black colour or very dark brown. 

There is always a percentage of this reaction happening during the processing, being at around 20-30% or lower in [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] and other high grade [[Sencha 煎茶]]. This high grade teas have their deep green, bluish black color preserved, characteristic of Japanese green teas. And at around 50% or higher in deep steamed teas [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] or teas with a long heat exposure.

During the storage of tea temperature and humidity or non airtight packaging or container can also let the Chlorophyll breakdown to happen.
