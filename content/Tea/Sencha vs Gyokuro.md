# Sencha vs Gyokuro
Perhaps the most noticeable difference between [[Sencha ç…ŽèŒ¶]] and [[Gyokuro çŽ‰éœ²èŒ¶]] are the shading as the [[Processing method è£½èŒ¶æ–¹æ³•]] can be quite similar at first glance.

Sencha is grown under sun exposure, it presents a green leaf colour but not as bright and darl as a Gyokuro due to a higher content of [[Chlorophyll]] that can also have a bluish tonality. 

The brew of a Sencha is more yellowish while the gyokuro presents  a lighter greener colour.
