Presents more of the production in the northern area, where there are more flatlands as well. The south centre is more mountainous.

Tea started in the 13th century, was quite early, with a monk bringing seeds from China. For a while until 150 years ago, Mie was the highest producing region for tea in Japan, until the rise of [[Shizuoka 静岡]] as the biggest producer.

Unique features is the presence of famous pottery style [[Bankoyaki]] one of the main styles for Kyushu teapots. Together with [[Tokoname]]. Pottery from this area is famously rich in iron so but due to low oxygen firing ovens, the iron in the pots cannot oxidize to red as with other firing techniques. So it ends with a more brownish metallic aspect.

The flatlands are the main are of production from Mie, still a bit of hills not full flat but still able to use driven machines.

They are most known for [[Sencha 煎茶]] as many other regions, but commonly used before as a filler tea for the Kyoto tea region market. Due to the drop in price and the necessity to boost the local production and brand, they started cultivation and created the [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] tea. A shaded tea that is not as long shaded as [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] but not sun grown like [[Sencha 煎茶]]. 

This tea developed about 20-30 years ago, it was promoted as Gyokuro that you can prepare with boiling water. Netto Gyokuro ネット玉露 neto means boiling water. Now, it is also recommended to cool down the water a bit for this kind of teas, but it was created to be a Gyokuro that you could brew more casually.

Mie holds around 68% of the production of Kabusecha with [[Fukuoka]] and [[Shizuoka 静岡]] at 7% after that.
