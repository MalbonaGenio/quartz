# Brewing factors
- Type of tea
- Temperature
- Part of the leave used
- Water type
- Tea quality
- Time
- **Tea:water** ratio

## Water quality
Hard water clouds and masks the tea flavour. Soft water makes it more vividly, clear.

## Extraction rates
From 60Cº and up the rate of extraction of [[Catechin]] (Astringency), and [[Caffeine]] (Bitterness) increases a lot. [[L-Theanine]] extraction levels increases a bit as well but not as drastically. In second and third infusions using higher temperatures will help extract more flavour but need to consider that some flavour are already extracted or depleted, affecting the flavour.
