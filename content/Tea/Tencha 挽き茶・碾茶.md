Tencha is the leaf used to produce [[Matcha 抹茶]], a powdered tea made from ground tea leafs, traditionally in a stone mill. It is one of the highest grade tea together with [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], made with young buds and leaves, in some cases harvested by hand. [[Harvesting methods 収穫方法]]

The tea leafs are shaded around 21 days using the canopy [[Japanese tea shading techniques|shading technique]] either using traditional bamboo and rice straw method or the modern synthetic cheesecloth. In this process the leafs are harvested by hand for the high-grade versions and sometimes the normal grade ones as well, processed using the [[Steamed processed teas 蒸し製]] manufacturing techniques but skipping any rolling of the leaf. Just the steaming and drying is performed, no rolling as it will be ground after being blende in most cases. Also it is usually let to rest over some months to let the bitter compounds to break down and enhance the sweetness and umami of the final product. There can also be a summer harvest for lower grade product like culinary grade matcha.
