# Kagoshima ÈπøÂÖêÂ≥∂

Includes regions like:

- Chiran 
- Ei
- Kirishima
- Oura
- Takabe
- Ariake
- Tanegashima
- Yakushima

Tea is grown all around the sea line with very few mountain sides having operations as the mountains in the Kagoshima area can be very high altitude of 1700 meters in some areas.

Chiran alone is the single biggest producing in all Japan, taking up around 18% of the Japanese production. Kagoshima is a relative flatland along its coast, which allows for big scaled operations to take place and as well the weather is quite mild and humid. With not super hot summers or very cold winters, allowing for a longer window for harvesting.

Kagoshima sea coastline is quite low altitude, for example Kirishima at around 300 meters of altitude is considered a "mountain" grown tea. This gives Kagoshima a bit less variations on the flavour profiles that can be found. Kagoshima though have a few islands like Tanegashima and Yakushima, which gives a bit of a different profile than cannot be found in other regions. As they have a more tropical weather not found in the bigger islands or mainlands.

The development into growing tea is not very well known, and it seems it is very recent compared to other regions, dating back to the 19th century. In specific, after the 2nd world war. Its beginnings as well are in the black tea production, which did not hold up as other regions were growing it way cheaper when Japan open up for trade. 

Tea is very extended and can be usually found next to other important infrastructures like airports, villages and other infrastructure.

One of the famous places comes from the historical developments from the airports in World War 2, with the well-known Kamikaze pilots from the Chiran Kamikaze airport, one of the biggest airports. This military spaces were torn apart and big areas became tea fields later on as it was very good flat land for it.

Kagoshima also has a lot of active volcanos, biggest add to the soil composition and the ashes that they provide, one of the biggest and most active one is the Sakurajima volcano. This has a drawback that tea leafs need to be washed prior to processing to remove the ashes. This is not well documented or investigated, but it is tough that this washing step makes the tea milder, as it might remove or wash out part of the compound in the tea leafs.

95% of the land is harvested with driven machine and the factories are quite large too. A later development of Kagoshima as tea producer and specially after ww2 where the machinery was already more common and more developed allowed for a better planning and a better infrastructure that could be scaled up in the future.

Teas being make are kind o fsimilar to [[Shizuoka ÈùôÂ≤°]] with [[Sencha ÁÖéËå∂]] and [[Fukamushi Ê∑±Ëí∏„Åó]] tea being very common. An interesign fact was that due to the later development into a tea producing region and the lack of a strong recognisable brand around it like in Uji or Kyoto, a lot of tea was sent to Shizuoka as bulk or filler tea. Due to a less expensve tea, it copuld be mixced and sell as Shizuoka tea. That is until brands were developent and stregthen like the one of Chiran.

Now they also have their own market for auctions and have several strong brands associated with the region an the rest of the areas as well.

A particularity of Kagoshima is the prevalence of organic farming being very well regarded. I accounts 41% of the organic farmland in Japan, With shizuoka being in the second spot at 18% and Miyazaki at 11%.
