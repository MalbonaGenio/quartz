# Temperature and Infusion time relation
Different temperatures solubilise different compounds, like caffeine for example. The time will in part allow more of them to be diffused into the brew. Sometimes it can also happen that a compound is present in the brew but not solubilised, this is especially true in lower temperature infusions.

The three most well know components for green tea are amino-acids, caffeine and catechin. While amino-acids are easily solubilised even at lower temperatures, caffeine and catechin are no so soluble. Their solubilisation and total transfer %  increases greatly as the temperature is higher. This makes it easier for transferring them into the brew together with all the other compounds that make a tastier cup into the brew. It is not always the desired result or the best to present a balance and the most umami into the cup without bitterness in high grade teas like [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]].

Amino acids will imbue the brew with umami and sweet notes while compounds like caffeine and catechin provide the cup with bitterness or astringency. Lower temperature usually presents umami, sweetness, bitterness and astringency in balance. Present but not overwhelming, this can be a desirable cup but most of the time lacking in intensity if the period of infusion is to short. 

A higher temperature results in a stronger cup if the brew time is too long, excessive water temperature or both. It usually also presents a more prominent astringency and bitterness. 

It is important then to adapt the brew time and water temperature to that that most suit the quality and process of the tea, as well as, the type of brew we want to result of it. [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]], high grade [[Sencha 煎茶]], [[Kabusecha 被せ煎茶・被せ茶]] will probably benefit of a lower temperature  with a longer initial brew. In the case of high grade [[Gyokuro 玉露茶]] is not uncommon to use as low a 40-50ºC with 1-2 minutes infusion with a very short ratio of tea:water to extract as much umami and sweetness out of it as possible. 

Brews of [[Hojicha ほうじ茶・焙じ茶]] can traditionally be brewed with boiling water directly in a water kettle for several minutes, resulting in a very intense brew.
