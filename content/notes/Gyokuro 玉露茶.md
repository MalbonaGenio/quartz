higher grade teas made with the young buds and leaves harvested in Spring only usually.

玉露 leaves are usually covered on a canopy structure on top of the bushes, no directly blanketed he shading is also more prolonged at around 20 days. The shading provides the tea with a strong sweetness and umami as the Catechin content is limited due to the limited sun exposure. The shading also provides the tea with the "shading-aura" or aroma 覆い香. 

It can be harvested by machine but also hand picking for the highest quality grades as well as competition grade teas. The processing way is usually the same as for facturing process.
